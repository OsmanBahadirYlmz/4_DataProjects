I have very absorbent towels, but he always says they’re too scratchy. However, I always felt his towels were too plush and almost didn’t absorb any water at all. I bought these in hopes we’d find a compromise. I washed them first, like the directions stated, warm water, tumble dry low, no fabric softener or dryer sheets, separate from other items. I used one and thought, “Oh no! This is very absorbent! My boyfriend will probably think they aren’t soft enough!” (I am easy to please about softness.) He used one and I braced for impact....and....He LOVED them! He thought they were just the right amount of softness, and I didn’t think they were too plush. They are perfect. I have them in four colors. We replaced all of our towels with these. Good quality and have kept their bright colors after many washes. Would recommend to anyone and everyone.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21QIYPMZ52DEL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08RP8M6T5","B01H65F6A0","Size: 6 Piece Towel Set | Color: Bright White"

I was also concerned that these would be the kind of towels that shed all over your body when drying off, especially since I bought these in black. Lastly, I was concerned if it would be thick enough and good quality. I received these two days ago and washed them before using. I figured I’d have to wash these a few times for them not to shed on me. Wow!!! I can’t say enough about how perfect these towels are!!! I’m VERY picky(if you hadn’t noticed). These blew my expectations out of the water!! I used for the first time this morning and could not believe fantastic these are!! First, they are SO soft and fluffy and they feel much thicker than they look! Fantastic quality (so far). These are incredibly absorbant and dry very quickly. And as to the shedding, I really couldn’t believe it! These towels after only one wash hardly shed AT ALL!!! The amount they did was minimal and I can tell shedding should be completely non existent after a few more uses. These are the best (that I can remember) towels I’ve ever bought. After using these once, I doubt I’ll go back to other towels. Also, the hand towel is great because it had NO shed AND it dries so fast, you don’t have to worry about a damp hand towel after washing your hands a few times!!! I suggest these for anyone, but especially for the picky people like myself! You will not be disappointed!

They were thin, they were lifeless, and my initial impression was that they may have been manufactured from cardboard. I fell into a mild depression as I realized that the bulk of my order, the bath towels, and hand towels hadn't even been delivered yet, and I already had buyer's remorse.HOWEVER....that's right... keep reading!!They came with a nice little card that explained to wash them first, then tumble dry low. I washed them with a basic Tide pod, no fabric softer. That last part of those instructions had me a little confused though. My dryer has a setting that specifically says ""Towels"" and when I pressed that button, it automatically selects high heat. I decided to take a chance, and try something new. I chose a timed dry on low heat. No dryer sheets either.I came back later and opened the dryer to find the most beautiful, fluffy, and soft washcloths I have ever seen or touched!!

SUPER VALUE","I bought these towels because I had gotten tickets to take my son to Cedar point & then their water park the following day ... my current towels were ragged & I didn't want to look like a hobo lol.Towels are expensive and so I try to get the best bang for my buck (who doesn't), so I figured I would try these...Long story short... first day at Cedar point my face got horribly sun burnt. So once at the hotel the first thing I did was wash my face from a day of sweating... it was like a horror movie using their washcloth on my face! It HURT soooo bad! (Ironically they had a sign up in the bathroom saying if you took a wash cloth it was $2 and $9 for snagging a towel that I wouldn't give 2 cents for).Anyway lucky for me we brought these towels for the park! They saved my flesh!! SO much softer!!  I did not use the hotel towels except for a bath mat & they didn't even work for that. I have to add they are very absorbent which I was worried about with them being thin... I also have well water which is rough on towels & these are doing much better than the ones I got at W-mart about a month ago... (I don't use fabric softener on towels even with my hard water & these are STILL softer & more absorbent than the torture towels at the hotel)Some reason I can only upload one pic right now, but I took a pic I will add to show the W-mart ones in comparison... they may look similar BUT way different! W-Mart ones are being converted to rags as they are useless and falling apart.

After reading the bad reviews, I was hesitant because the amount of lint and shedding seemed to be mentioned frequently.  However, I took a leap and order the towels that I wanted. I followed the instructions about the first washing and yes... there was a lot of lint the first wash. Considerably less the second wash and I imagine the amount will continue to decrease with additional use/washes.  The softness and size is exactly what I hoped for.  The towels are thick and the quality is excellent.  If the lint from the first 2 washes is a concern of yours... I personally believe the positives far outweigh the negatives for this product. Also, I have never purchased a brand new towel that did not shed extra lint the first couple of washes. I purchased dark colored towels and the color is exactly the same after 2 washes with no fading. The only reason it has 4 stars instead of 5 is because the thickness of the towel makes it a bit heavy and slow to dry after use.  A very minor trade off for the size and softness. If the amount of lint doesn't decrease or if this becomes a problem with fibers transferring onto my body during use. I will update my review.  As of now, I am happy with my purchase.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZHOJ0JF48RSL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08RP8M6T5","B084KJ71SJ","Size: 40x80'' Oversized Bath Towel | Color: Chocolate Brown"

I have previously purchased this brand in a peach shade and also a medium tone blue. I was very pleased with quality and softness. My issue with the burgundy is that the COLOR BLEEDS HORRIBLY. After receiving this item, and knowing red dye can stain, I soaked these cloths in a tub of cold water. Only a slight amount of red color was found in the water, so I washed them in machine in cold water. However, I’m consistently finding that when a used damp cloth of the burgundy red color is tossed into laundry hamper, it leaves red stain on everything it touches. So, for this reason, I can not recommend this product.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKFEVKHOE8CGC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08RP8M6T5","B08572H382","Size: 4 Piece Washcloth Set | Color: Turquoise Blue"

The point of buying new towels is that they look new for awhile... So, POOR POOR QUALITY!3. The colors are not the same in person. Online the purple color looks a lot darker/deeper. In person, the purple is very bright and almost neon.4. Coming apart. These towels are very quick to come apart and snag, I've had them for almost a month and they have been snagging on everything.Overall, I've spent about $120 with this brand buying all different sizes of their towels and it was a waste for all of the above reasons and I read the reviews for hours before purchasing, I hope this helps make your decision to shop elsewhere.The only good things, they are large, soft and very thick but that's not enough to chose this brand.",1,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LITDSJZRV44V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08RP8M6T5","B08JM85PNK","Size: 35x70'' Jumbo Bath Towel | Color: Violet Purple"

So last summer I decided to take a chance, and I ordered two 3-towel sets (washcloth, hand towel, bath towel) in Grey and Colonial Blue.The colors are great, although the Colonial Blue has a little more green in it than what you see online, and one slight bummer is that the 2 sets were not the same texture. (The Grey is a softer texture, and the Colonial Blue - while still soft - was a more closely woven texture.) The other bummer was that the bath towels seemed small... I blame my husband for this, as he introduced me to bath sheets a couple years ago and subsequently ruined normal-sized towels for me.After months of using puny bath towels, I'd had enough. It was time for an upgrade! I bought 2 of these jumbo bath towels and I'm so happy I did!I was a little concerned when they first arrived, because the Colonial Blue one looked greener than the previous set and I thought it wouldn't match. I figured I'd just throw caution to the wind and wash it anyway, hoping that would help, and thankfully it did. They came out of the dryer super soft and fluffy, and the colors matched perfectly.I've had no issues with lint after the first wash ( I always add some white vinegar when washing towels), but I have noticed they start to get ""linty"" when they need to be washed again. Aside from that though, these towels are amazing and I love them!",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E6VR4W1MGYFC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08RP8M6T5","B07ZS4TCY1","Size: 35x70'' Jumbo Bath Towel | Color: Dark Grey"

These, so far, fit the bill.  They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in great shape with some other items I had ordered.  Will update if anything changes after washing.UPDATE  11/7/2020.... Ok. I have now washed and dried these... yes there was dryer lint... but not overly so.  They are new.  There's gonna be lint.  After having said that, I feel very confident about my 5 star review.  In fact, I went back and ordered 4 larger size bath towels. These towels are weighty.. soft and richer feeling that I was expecting after washing and drying.  No threads - appear to be well sewn.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2021","Noone","yes","yes","Unfriendly black towels with relentless, prodigious lint-making ability.","These black towels continually shed large lint balls when handled (removing from dryer, folding or hanging on towel bars, and during actual use); floors end up seeming to be covered with black bug bodies.  Both sides of the towels have had firmly-attached pills since initial laundering (making them far less soft) and quickly appeared old and worn.  The washer drum is covered with wet black lint when the towels are removed, and the dryer's lint trap is thickly packed even after multiple washings.  A chic color and the allure of thickness are not sufficient to compensate for having to pick lint balls off hair and body (hoping you find them all!) and vacuum the bathroom floor after towel use, or for having to wipe out the washer before doing a different load.  The set I purchased has been discarded, but left behind lint ball stragglers in hidden places to haunt the unwary by wafting out when least expected.  Evidently, you cannot get them all by wiping or suction -  or, they divide to conquer.  (Let's not even think about replication at night.)

FUZZ EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME!!!","I have made a special point of reviewing these towels now after having purchased them some time ago, due to the frustration continually encountered when using them prior to getting ready in the morning.This morning was the straw that broke the camel's back.FUZZ EVERYWHERE!!!!Yes, I've washed them. I've dried them. I've washed them again. It seems to make no difference!!!!After using these towels, I spend so much unnecessary time picking towel fuzz and lint off my face, both directly after washing, and after applying my makeup. They just won't go away!!!Of course, I purchased the black towels, so the fuzz/lint looks like stubble.For this reason alone, these towels are the worst I've ever purchased and are becoming the bane of my morning existence.If you want your houseguests to stay only briefly, put these towels in your guest bathroom.For Pete's Sake! Don't even buy them for washing your car! What a disaster that'd be!The dog would even balk at being dried off with these things...Mopping up unexpected appliance floods, perhaps? No! Not even that! They're not even all that absorbant.For the life of me, I can't figure out why these are labeled ""luxury"" or the #1 Bestseller in towels.Word to the wise: Look elsewhere or spend all of your time looking at how much towel fuzz has adhered itself to your skin!!!!",1,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PGFDNTBUYKYH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08RP8M6T5","B07Z6J5DB1","Size: 6 Piece Towel Set | Color: Black"

I bought these towels based on the large number of 5 stars without checking the 1 star reviews.  My mistake.  I must have received very different towels than those 5 star reviewers. First, they smelled strongly of chemicals. So strongly, I could smell them while wrapped in plastic and before I ever opened the shipping box. In spite of the smell, I liked the color which was just what I wanted. I washed them per the instructions in warm water, Gain detergent with no bleach of any kind and dried them on low heat. The towels were very soft when I took them out of the dryer but they looked like the color had faded. I thought it was my imagination. It was not. When I hung one of the bath towels, I noticed what looked like tan splotches on the towel. Hoping it was the lighting I took the towel into bright light and realized the dye had faded and left tan splotches on both bath towels. I then read the 1 star reviews and learned this was a fairly common problem. I’m returning the towels and will go on the hunt for better quality towels.

We washed the towels before using it and the amount of lint that ended up on the rest of the clothes were ridiculous, I had to re-wash the load of laundry. For paying the amount of money it cost these are not worth it. They are not fluffy, flat, and  produce an huge amount of lint. The only pro was the color of the towels.

These are the perfect size and weight  and they dry you right up without being rough and scratchy, they actually feel really soft and luxurious on the skin.

These are remarkable in the amount of lint they produce. After a few washes, the hand towels still left enough lint on my hands I had to rinse them again. So I spent a day washing and drying the whole group of red towels I purchased, they ran through five times. Amazingly, they are still producing lint! It doesn’t coat my hands anymore, but it falls all over the floor when the towels are used and gets on anything that goes in the wash with them. I wasn’t going to give them a negative review on the lint alone, but they have also been bleeding color on anything white they rub against while wet. Since I bought the deep red towels, I now have many pink things. I’m quite frustrated and would not recommend these towels. They are soft and a nice thickness, and the red is a great color, but not worth the lint and color bleeding!",1,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XVGARNIPH9AQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08RP8M6T5","B07ZS3125Q","Size: 6 Piece Towel Set | Color: Burgundy Red"

Be sure to check the lint trap in your dryer midway through the drying cycle.  After that initial wash/dry, the towel produce very little lint.  The other thing we noticed about the towels is there are definitely 2 different towel sets you can receive.  We noticed the sets had 2 different tags and a slightly different shade of white.

I use them in my short-term rental property. I wanted to switch to gray because it's difficult to keep the white bright after a year or so of use. I expected the same towel as the white towels only in gray. They are not.  The white towels are soft and have a tight nap (small loop) making them resistant to snagging. The Rockridge Gray towels have a loose nap and feel thinner. I'm concerned that they will have a comparatively short useful life as they will be more prone to snags. Although they are new, they look rumpled and shabby right out of the dryer.Color is another issue. I previously ordered hand towels only in ""Gray"". The weave and color were as expected.  This set is supposedly the same towels, but they were only available in ""Rockridge Gray"" and ""Dark Gray,"" but not ""Gray."" The photo appears to show a tight nap, but again, it is a loose, larger-loop nap.I'll keep them, but I feel that I was deceived.

I decided to give this set of towels a chance, ordered 1 set of them followed the directions pulled them out of the bag, shook them out and put in washer (i have a towel setting on mine). Dried them (cleaned the lint tray out couple of times while they were drying). They came out nice and fluffy with a definite increase in volume on them. Used them for a week or 2 before deciding to take the plunge in purchasing more, we did and at first we had issues using the 10% off next purchase. Got in contact with seller and within a few days code was working. We have sent the towels through several washings and dryings and so far so good.  As you can see in attached pictures they fluff up really nice. That was after 1 washingUPDATE: I ordered the towels on July 13th (2021)and received them on July 16th or17th washed following instructions. The towels have been used 2 to 3 at the most and have already started following apart. Company has been notified and I will change the star rating once they respond . I am really disappointed they are already falling apart with very little use.NEW UPDATE: I was in contact with the seller and they took care of the issue that we were having by sending new one. So star rating has been put back to 5 star.

Now the product that arrived, the feel was not that great at first, will check after running through washer and dryer if the feel changes at all but their not nearly as good as the ones my step mom has which are also Turkish cotton. Value for money is to me a little unfair based on what I got and the difference in what my step mom has and what this company makes, like I know it’s a different company but their a decent difference in hers and these ones.

This is normal I think...it is basically new towels and different from towels that has been sitting on shelves at the stores. Anyways wash them before use.

You may be shocked when you look at your dryer filter even after two consecutive wash and dry cycles.  We like the variety of colors that make it easy complement our decor.  At this point our gold standard for longevity is Biltmore. We continue to use several sets after 5 years or more and they remain soft and absorbent.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2021","Mr. Matthew Ryan Brooks","yes","-","Lint City","After at least 12 washes, all of the bath towels that I purchased (five total) are still producing copious amounts of lint. I cannot use the towels to dry myself after a shower without covering myself in it. I'm used to seeing lint from a quality product after one or two washes, but to see it after twelve is unreasonable. As soon as I begin to dry off, I'm forced to throw the towel into the bin and use the next one, until its lint production becomes equally intolerable. Thus, I get only a single, partial use out of each towel before needing to wash it again. Obviously, there is some kind of quality deficiency behind this.

There are so many towels that just come in white and it was easy to find some in shades of grey or other neutral tones but not so easy to find tan shades. Therefore, I was very pleased to see the range of colors offered by American Linen. I ordered the tan color from them and another set from a different brand to see what matched best. The ones from American Linen were a perfect tone to compliment the paint color - not taupe, not yellow, not blue tones but just a very nice sand tone. I washed them first and dried with my wool dryer balls and they came out nice and soft. I have found them to be absorbent as well. They are new so hopefully I will also find they hold up well.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JPKTXHBFQGC5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08RP8M6T5","B07ZRYZGFK","Size: 6 Piece Towel Set | Color: Sand Taupe"

"Reviewed in Canada on May 20, 2021","MrsPink","yes","-","Love It!","Absolutely Love it!! I bought this towel for my daughter. She’s heavy set. So normal sized towel don’t quite wrap around her properly. So I bought her one of these. It’s a great size. It wraps around her with lots to spare. She feels much more comfortable going from the shower to her bedroom. Before she’d wrap herself in 2 towels. Just to make sure she was covered. Because like me. She doesn’t like getting dressed in the hot bathroom with damp skin. It’s nice to wrap it around you and wait for your skin to dry. Is Soft and Thick as well. And the colour is so vibrant. I want one for myself now. Plan to purchase one for myself in the near future. Highly recommend.",5,"-","-","-","B084KVWM49","Size: 40x80'' Oversized Bath Towel | Color: Lemon Yellow"
