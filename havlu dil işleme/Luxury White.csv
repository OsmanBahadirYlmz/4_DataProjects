They are not leaving fuzz behind. I washed before I used them and they were just fine. I do not have fuzz all over myself or the bathroom.  They are not covering everything in fuzz when I wash them.

I washed one set in warm water, no fabric softener, and dried them. I folded them and opened a second set and compared the washed thickness to the thickness straight out of the package. Big difference! They really fluff up a lot when you wash them. One set produces a handful of lint. I‚Äôm anxious to see if that continues but I hope it doesn‚Äôt. I deducted one star because they did feel a bit softer straight out of the package.

Return to Amazon. Get a refund from White Classic. Get a replacement from White Classic. I opted for the replacement from White Classic. I was only expecting the 2 towels but this morning (Sunday no less!) USPS delivers an entire pink replacement package.

I LOVE these towels! I tried one just to see how they felt, and they are super absorbent. After showering, you only need to wipe once and all the water gets absorbed into the towel. The only thing is-- it tends to hold on to moisture, so the towel seems to stay wet longer (but it could be the winter weather, or the fact that it is actually taking in more moisture than other towels?)You need to wash it when you first get it - it does get significantly fluffier once you wash & dry (don't judge by how it comes out of packaging). I have washed these towels only about 4 times so I haven't had any issues with threads coming apart (only time will tell) but with 2 year warranty, I know I made the right choice buying these. I think I will start to slowly replace all of our home towels with these.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2020","Kenny355","-","-","These never quit shedding or bleeding","i purchased these in Burgundy for my guest bathroom. I washed them when i received them and hung them in the guest bathroom. The first guest that used them had to holler from the bathroom asking for another set of towels. She had to take a second shower to wash and rinse off the burgundy fuzz the towels left her covered with. I washed them again at the time, with some of my gray bath towels and they left them with burgundy fuzz and a pink tint. I washed them again, separate from anything else and put them in the guest bathroom again, and this weekend, same result. Fuzzy guest. I washed them one more time this morning and dried them only to get an overloaded lint filter. Yep, burgundy fuzz. These towels now reside in my trash container til it gets emptied on Tuesday. I'm shocked that suchan inferior product is actually put on the market, and would say this is the worst purchase I have made on Amazon.
