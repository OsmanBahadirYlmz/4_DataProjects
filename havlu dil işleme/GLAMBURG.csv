You never think about towels. They just hang in the bathroom and keep you dry. After one washing these towels  filled both my washing machine and dryer with brown lint balls, the lint trap had to be cleaned out 3 times in the first washing, and when I took out the towels, they were pilled, and the sewing was unravelling on some of the pieces. I included a picture because I included a few other things in the wash with the towels and EVERYTHING is covered in lint. Very cheap. They couldn't even be considered rag quality. Poor quality cotton, thin, not absorbent. I included a picture of what the lint looked like on a couple of other things coming out of the machine. I guess I was crazy to think you could wash dark towels with other dark things. When I looked at the 4 1/2 stars, I was stumped.

As far as all the complaints about the excess lint.....I washed this set by itself.  I have never washed towels with any other laundry; just bath towels alone.  Washed them twice; Warm water; to make sure all sizing was out.  NO fabric softener - all that does is make towels Less absorbent as it coats the fibers to make them feel soft; just plain white vinegar in the softener dispenser.  Med High spin speed to avoid wrinkles and excess dryness.  Towels in dryer on Low Heat with natural sheep's wool dryer balls.  The lint screen had more lint than when I wash our current towels but that's exactly what I would expect with new towels.I have no complaints; would recommend to anyone who prefers a thinner bath towel.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FCWETRUT8BB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07Y22QK1S","B082QWGCPH","Color: Peach"
