"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2015","Ron Johnson","yes","yes","Could ALL the Reviews Be Right?","After careful research and reading many of the reviews, pro and con for these towels I believe, after having them for the past two months, that everyone is correct. Those who said that these towels were plush and softer after each washing are correct. Those who said you can get as good, or better a towel from the big box stores are also correct. Here's my story. I purchased a set and was happy enough with them that two weeks later, I purchased another set of four. Shortly after the second purchase my wife tells me that Sam's Club is selling a towel that's bigger and looks just as good for $6.99. We've purchased towels from the warehouse folk before and they were like trying to dry off with the front door mat, so I wasn't too worried, but said we would get one just to see how it stood up. Here's the stats: The Amazon towels, (i.e. Soft Touch Linen) are made in Turkey under the brand name Chakir Linen. They measure 49 x 26 and weigh 21 ounces. The Sam's Club towel was sold under the brand name Hotel Luxury Reserve is made in India and measures 54 x 28 and weighs 25.5 ounces. This was after both towels were washed at least twice. The Amazon towel feels slightly thicker, the Sam's Club towel feels slightly softer. The only complaint that my wife had about the Sam's Club towel, it has three ribbings at the end whereas the Amazon towel has only one. She said these strips kind of get in the way. So far all towels are holding up pretty good, no fraying, or loose threads.Also, be weary of the ""also bought"" line. I purchased the ""matching"" hand towels and wash cloths. Only they weren't really matching, not a big deal, but not even the same brand and, I thought, since I'm buying the bath towels they will no doubt just send the other merchandise with them. No. Got the bath towels on the Prime two day free shipping deal. Waited an extra four, or five days for the rest of the stuff, and paid a pretty good shipping fee for them as well.",4,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IvjNTjleL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27W5QPYFWV0ZP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"
"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2014","MiamiTechnoLawyer","yes","yes","Great Towel, Outstanding Value 4.5 Stars","I ordered these towels and an Amazon house brand Pinzon Egyptian Cotton 625 gram weight towel set at the same time.  I was very pleased with both products. This towel is slightly softer, and a little heavier/thicker than the 625 gram Pinzon.  While both towels are the same length the Pinzon is 4 inches wider.  The Pinzon is made in Pakistan and the this towel is made in Turkey a country known for terrycloth robes and towels.  Is this this heaviest, softest, nicest towel I have ever seen.  No.  If you visit a high end department store, you can find a thicker, softer towel, by a designer name that is better but it will cost you well over twenty dollars a towel, twice the price of these.  These towels are a superb value at $10.00 each.  This towel be as good or better as any towel you will find in the $15.00 to $20.00 range at Target, Lands End, and the like.  I am at a loss to  explain the handful of one and two star reviews for this product.  If I had to give category grades I would say  Softness A, Weight A, Size B+/A-, Value A+.  I would order this product again without hesitation.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34NVM21IVCHGD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

We looked for comparable towels for our new sauna at some of the big box retailers, but couldn't justify paying $20+ for a single towel, so we took a gamble and bought this set.  We followed the instructions on the site to soak the towels in cold water for 12 hours.  We left them in the pre-soak setting in our washer overnight.  We didn't use any detergents or softeners as advised.  And they were noticeably fluffier when we pulled them out of the dryer.  We also love the fact that they don't use any harmful chemicals.  As long as these hold up for some period of time, we are some happy campers.The gray towels are the ones that we purchased.  The 4 gray towels are noticeably more plush than the 5 white towels stacked next to them.  Incredibly satisfied with this purchase, and will most certainly purchase again.",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818dF2r0pIL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8TCZC6ABL4HE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B07YW41GDJ","Color: Gray"

"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2016","Girl_Style","yes","yes","Don't last long...","—UPDATE—After half of a rental season I have to say these aren't what I expected. They have lost all softness and are now scratchy and thin.I am very picky about laundry so I do all of the rental laundry myself. I regularly wash the towels in a load of vinegar to remove any lingering smells or body oils and then use TIDE free & clear. I have bleached them a few times due to dark stains or makeup and rewashed with vinegar afterwards and dry on medium-high with dryer balls.They have been washed & used about 10-12 times and I am no longer comfortable placing them in the rental since they are so thin and scratchy. Will be looking elsewhere for towel supplies.—ORIGINAL REVIEW—We have had these for about 6 months in a vacation rental property. I can't review their longevity because this is the first season of use and we are just opening up the property for booking. However, they have been washed a hand full of time and have held up with no loose threads or loss to softness. I recommend that you wash them right after they arrive with a cup full of vinegar and use wool balls in the drier to decrease amount of drying time needed (the less dry time to fluffier they stay=less lint loss) as well as increase softness due to tumble actin of the balls. I am impressed with how very soft these towels are, they absorb water very well and dry within an hour when hung on a towel bar.",2,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12NQJ25KJVO65/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

Why is it that when I'm an adult, all of my stuff is never quite as nice as it was when mom and dad were taking care of everything?Then I found these towels. They cost a little more than something you'd buy in a department store or something, but it's definitely worth it. I actually had these in my cart on Amazon for quite a while before one day I decided to take the plunge. I was worried about spending this much on towels only to have them show up and not be all that different from the other towels I've got.I am so glad I got them.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2015","Esoteric","yes","yes","Good Quality & Great Value - 4.5 stars","I originally purchased these towels together with a set of hand towels from the same manufacturer about a year ago from Amazon. After a year of usage, I am highly satisfied with the quality of the towels -- enough to recommend them for my parents who needed new towels recently. Unlike towels that I have previously purchased from well-known department stores, these do not fray after months of usage and washing. If you use a small amount of bleach when washing these towels (together with a laundry detergent for whites), they will also maintain a fairly brilliant white color.I would say these towels are as good as (if not better) than towels you'd expect to find at a 5 star hotel. They are soft to the touch, they feel comfortable on the body, and they dry both skin and hair quite effectively. They are not overly plush, nor are they too thin.If I were to mention one minor caveat, it would be the size of these towels. Be advised that they do shrink when you first wash them (I would say about 10% shrinkage is typical). As far as bath towels go, larger is better, and while these towels are sufficiently large enough to get you get you dry after a bath or shower, it would have been better if they were a bit larger.Having said that, these towels are still a great value for the quality of product that you will receive. If you are a new homeowner, newly married couple or just in the market for new towels for your household, you can stop fretting the decision and go with these towels. After a year of usage, would purchase these towels again without hesitation.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RPVX9CIGRFER/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2016","@TheBakedNurse","yes","yes","Love","Wow. I've always bought cheap towels from Walmart or Target. But I am moving into a new house and needed to get all new everything.Towels are something we/most of us use on a daily basis. You don't think much of them until you step out of the shower and wrap a scratchy or worn out towel around you, or worse yet, one that continually leaves lint alllllll over your body.I wanted to upgrade and buy nice towels for one in my life. These aren't cheap (to me) so I was hesitant to click the buy button...until I realized if I were ordering a couple pizzas for my family I'd think nothing of the cost...and a pizza doesn't last buy a day, or two if your lucky. It's funny how we compare or are hesitant to spend money, at times, on quality items we use on a daily basis vs handing over the debit card for a really good (and expensive) dinner out with your family.OK. So these towels are just awesome. I ordered them in white. My whole family have been excited to use these. They are incredibly soft, absorbent and dry quickly. They are not too thick or thin, and the size is perfect. I didn't want towels the size of a beach towel but certainly not small either. These wrap around perfectly, even for my 6'2"" muscular husband.I'm never go back to cheap towels again. I've already bought another set of these and plan to buy 2 more sets next month.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22QGUOTCQ6SHB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

The last batch I bought actually had thread that over time shrunk in the dryer.

After checking out a number of options, the “Luxury Hotel & Spa Bath Towel 100% Genuine Turkish Cotton, 27"" x 54"" , Set of 4, White” was decided the top towel option by our family.  They are soft, absorb water quickly, dry within a reasonable time, have beautiful color options, and are affordable.  I have only washed and dried the “test” purchase set of 4, white 27” x 54” towels once but so far they are still wonderfully soft and thick with no other visible problems.

It's near impossible to buy towels online w/o seeing or touching them first. You just don't know what you're going to wind up with. So I took a chance (which I do all the time) and these towels seemed to hold up well in the wash (I washed them 3 times before putting them to use, just to make sure I didn't need to return them, in case they fell apart in the wash or dryer). So far, so good. They've been through the wash and dry probably 5 times already and they're holding up nicely. (I've decided to stay with white for most all of my towels, as my colored towels wound up coming out of the dryer with what looks like bleach stains on them, even when I'm not using anything but plain old laundry detergent.) I often have overnight guests using my colored towels, and it's these that wind up looking weird and stained after laundering. I recently read that face creams containing benzol peroxide can cause this to happen, or other agents that are used on the skin.

I researched best towels of 2016, and almost every review I found (Best 10, Best 5, Best 3) listed these. I was pleased when they arrived, and doubly pleased the first time I used them. They are fluffy and very absorbent. They created a good bit of lint the first time I washed them, but I shook them really hard before putting them in the dryer and vacuumed up everything that fell off. The dryer filter was full at the end of the cycle, but no lint came off on my skin or hair the first time I used them. I like the fact that the hems are double-stitched, which I think will help prevent raveling. I read a tip in another review that I tried, which might be helpful. I washed the towels the first time with 2 cups of white vinegar, which the other reviewer says removes any coating that might have been applied at the factory to repel insects or stains. Then I gave them a second wash with my regular detergent. I bought white towels, but I won't be bleaching them, as bleach weakens fabric. So far, I give these towels five stars.

They're super soft, but not the kind of soft that doesn't absorb well. Very thick and plush. My only complaint is the size. The length is great, but the width seems just a couple inches too short compared to a ""normal"" towel. They barely cover my behind, and I'm not tall at all. I can't imagine a woman with a long torso or a lot of body fat being able to use them without flashing everyone in the house on the way back to her bedroom! So just keep that in mind: if you're tall or you have a lot to cover up, and you live with people you *don't* want to flash...these probably won't work. Buy some towels that are a few inches wider. But otherwise, these are lovely. Very plush and luxurious.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAQ2SOJL5F91G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

I don't know how many different name brands I tried before a friend of mine who also has a rental property, recommended these towels.  She told me that they get softer with each wash, and they were the best towels she's ever used.  Admittedly, I was skeptical.  Who ever heard of towels that get softer with each wash?  But she showed me hers, after a year of use, and I thought she was showing me a brand new towel.  They still looked amazing after several repeated washes.  So I took the plunge.Let me say this- these towels are a fantastic value considering the very high quality.  They come with instructions for care, follow them and you will be tickled with these towels. Don't use chlorine bleach, wash in cold water with half the amount of recommended detergent, and a half of cup of vinegar.  Wash the towels alone, don't add other dirty items in with them. They recommend three washes before use.  Dry on low heat. If you find one, cut the occasional loose thread before it unravels to keep your towels looking great. Since I haven't washed mine as much as my friend did, they aren't as soft yet, but she was right...the more you wash, the softer and fluffier they get.  They don't pill, and the amount of lint they produce in the dryer is minimal. My wash load usually consists of 12 bath towels, 6 hand towels and 6 washcloths. After drying, when the lint is collected off the screen, it balls up to the size of a golf ball. Pretty impressive!! I'm also finding that the amount of lint is reduced each time I dry them after washing.Once my budget allows it, I'm replacing my towels here at home with these as well.

Well, as soon as I received them, I could tell that washing them WASN'T going to make them much any loftier or plusher or fluffier than what they looked like packed in the plastic protective bag. And I was right. They are just AVERAGE after washing (and I used a full dispenser cup of fabric softener too, just to help them fluff up).Yes - they are soft, but a medium-thinish-weight towel. I have real ""plush"" 100% cotton towels that are about 7 years old that are still plusher to this day after hundreds of washings than what these towels are brand new. (If I could find that brand again - bought them at Costco - I'd buy more of those.) These new towels are a nice quality as far as the cotton, the terry-loops, and the sewing.But again ... they are NOT THICK, NOR PLUSH. These will probably not last more than a few years and then be flat, thin, rough towels.

I washed them and threw them in a hot dryer like I do the rest of my stuff since that's going to happen anyway.  So far so good.  I folded them and they're lovely, and fat and fluffy.  I don't even know if I've ever had or used Turkish towels before, but I do like these.  My older towels are supima cotton and made in the U.S., so they weren't inexpensive.  There isn't anything wrong with them, but I realized I now want white in my main bath, and these seemed like a good price if the quality stands up.  My older towels are not worn out, they were really just there for their matching and new appearance (we have our own towels we prefer to use every day(, so they're still substantial, they've just never been so lofty, and I sure wouldn't say they're fluffy like these Turkish towels are.  So is that what the hoopla over Turkish towels is all about?  I don't know, but these are quite nice, and deserve 5 stars.  I bought the matching face towels too.  Seems like they should offer hand towels here as well, but I'm not sure whether or not I'd buy them. Sometimes I find they just get in the way, people dry their hands off on the big ones or the face cloths, and the face cloths came in a pack of twelve, so maybe that'll work.  Anyway, I just ordered four more, and I can definitely recommend them.Update 3/23/2020;  Unlike some reviews I've read, I don't think they're getting softer and fluffier with subsequent washing.  They'll probably never be softer and/or fluffier than they are after the first laundering, but they're still pretty darned soft and fluffy.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FGNYBJZSLJF5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

I had a short time of 'turn around' from order to my door originally (of just days), then it was pushed out two weeks, yet I received them a week after ordering them.

I was quite pleasantly surprised with my purchase.  They are white, they're clean (no lose strings or poor seams), and most of all they are SOFT and nice and Big.  As I said, I honestly had high doubts about the quality size, and softness of the towels.  I expected to get these off white ragedy towels that could strip my skin right off.  Instead I opened the box and found 4 full sized bath towels that were quite soft.  Granted they aren't Terry Cloth by any means, and they aren't some crazy 700 thread count, they are still great for a towel that you bought off of Amazon.com for a whole ($40?) bucks.  I'm sure if you went down to a local department store you could find towels perhaps on sale and perhaps a touch softer, but given the convenience and 2 day shipping I don't think this can be beat for someone that has just moved into a new home, or for someone that is perhaps elderly or disabled or just does not enjoy getting out of the house and dealing with people.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMPMRPZXZOORM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2015","S. Cols","yes","yes","Great Towels!","Got 8 of these towels yesterday, they felt very nice right out of the package, just a little flattened. I immediately washed and dried them (4 at a time) on a wam wash cycle and High dryer heat. I have a large capacity washer and dryer but didn't want to overload them. Based on some comments here about lint, I set a timer for 15 minutes to clean the lint filter. It wasn't very full, but I continued to remove the lint every 15-20 minutes.  I compared the washed and dried towels and washcloths to an unwashed one, there was very little shrinking, less than 1"" over the entire length and width of the towel, even less for the washcloth. The towels looked and felt wonderful, fluffier after coming out of the dryer. The border did not shrink so the towel lays flat.  But the final test was after my shower last night: the towel was just the right weight: not so thick that it just pushed the water around on your skin, not so thin that it felt like a cheap hotel. It seems perfect. Of course, I've only had them for 1 day, but so far, I am really pleased with these towels. I have already suggested to my daughter that she remove the expensive towels on her wedding registry and get these instead.  Glad I came across these on amazon. Highly recommend.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OPPAZNQLY3M5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

The verdict: These ""Luxury"" towels are smaller, lighter in weight, and not as soft as the Fieldcrest, but they are slightly more absorbent.The biggest disappointment is the size: These are not as large as advertised. After one washing, they measure 26"" x 52"" (*not* the 27"" x 54"" shown in the listing description). Overall, I think these are OK towels, but they certainly don't meet my definition of ""luxury,"" and they aren't a special bargain at $10 each.Btw, my headline comment about buying online is not meant as a criticism of Amazon or this seller. I love love LOVE Amazon, and make hundreds of purchases here each year. But if you're fussy (as I am) about your towels, I think you need to touch, hold, feel, handle them in person.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2016","culturejamming","yes","yes","Not impressed at all","I should have paid more attention to the 1- and 2-star reviews but I figured there were more than enough positive reviews to counterbalance the negative ones.  These towels are marketed as being something special, something you're treating yourself with.  They aren't.  They are above-average in softness.  They are below-average in absorbency.  My old, tired, stiff, bleach-stained towels from years ago work way better than these when drying off after a shower.  The new Chakir towels leave a film of moisture on my body so I stand in front of the window AC unit briefly to finish the job.  This is probably the biggest fault and the primary reason I'm rating 2-stars, because bath towels have one job - to dry you off, and these do not accomplish even that.  They don't feel very substantial.  I wouldn't say they are thin, but they are thinner.  I can't comment on durability yet because I just received the towels last week but I will be sure to update down the road with how they're holding up.  They're not very large towels either.  I'm a 5'9"" slightly chubby male and this is by no means a beach towel or something I could cover my body with.  It wraps around my waist and goes down to about my knees with not a whole lot of towel to spare.  Overall, I'm disappointed and wish I would have just gone to a local store like Target or Boscovs to pick up the same thing for probably less money.",2,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CI5FK178JFYG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2015","TNcnsmr","-","yes","The size is large enough to satisfy even my husband","I was a bit nervous about ordering towels. So many expensive towels are soft, but not so absorbent, or tend to get scratchy after a few washings, or they shrink out of shape if they are 100% cotton. Being on a time crunch, I went ahead and ordered and kept my fingers crossed. These towels are not as expensive as many I've purchased in the past, but they are everything I could want in a bath towel. They are very absorbent, very soft, and come out of the dryer feeling and looking brand new. The size is large enough to satisfy even my husband, and that is saying a lot! He only likes using over-sized bath towels, and these ones more than meet his expectations. I don't usually rave about something so basic as a bath towel, but these ones deserve all the good things one can say about them!",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31WAOP5XGLHPF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

The cotton is soft, even after washing. The towels are generously sized. Perhaps most importantly, this whole set costs less than just two bath towels from the clearance section at other retail stores.As soon as they arrived, my 5 yr old daughter felt the cotton and claimed the whole set (hence the need to buy more)!As is to be expected with genuine Turkish cotton, they are not as ""thirsty"" as some other towels.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2014","Jeff Lebowski","-","yes","so far so good. Overall","I have purchased this towel set three times, so they're obviously worth the price. Few notes:1. They shed- I have to wash and dry these towels alone (particularly the drying) to avoid getting the balls of cotton on my other items. This trait lasts for multiple washes, so I've just taken to washing all the towels at once- but it's something I didn't anticipate.2. They are towel size- not bath sheets. Just as described in the posting, they are regular sizes towels.3. They are soft and relatively durable. In my first order (of eight), one towel immediately fell to pieces. The other seven were OK, and I didn't want to deal with any exchange. In this last order (of four), so far so good.Overall, I don't have a need for luxury, but these are definitely good enough for government work.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SOHXIV4BMPYK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2021","Elle O.","yes","-","Absorbent, Fluffy, Thick, Well-Made, but the Pink... read this review if you're considering Pink","These are nice towels at this price point. I just refuse to buy super-expensive towels, so I've been searching for months to find towels that were thick, fluffy, cotton, absorbent, and decent looking. These towels are all of that, and they are not meant to be the center of my design universe. They're just supposed to serve a purpose, and IMO, they do that quite well. I followed the instructions, washed them first in a scent-free detergent, no fabric softener, and dried them on low with some fluff balls in the dryer. They came out perfect. I used two immediately, and they were quite up to the task.BUT, if you are a person considering the pink and looking for a specific shade or range of shades, then this is for you:The pink is sort of a muted melted strawberry ice cream color, with perhaps a touch of chocolate syrup melted in with it. It is not an icy or blue pink, but it is also not a clear pink. I was hoping for a truer, more spa-like pink-- not baby-girl pastel, just a clear pink. Is the pink awful? No. I'm not going to send them back because I need the towels way more than I am disenchanted with the color. I think that they'll be fine. While I might not have chosen the pink originally if I'd seen it in person, I could see myself potentially ordering more of these since I'm already done this primrose path. I might try mixing them with the beige IF the beige is more ivory-like and less tan.Overall, especially at this price point, I would recommend these towels.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHQGP840T3STX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B07QNF1TGK","Color: Pink"
"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2019","Kathryn Magendie","yes","-","So soft - and the price is super reasonable!","I am so happy I ordered these towels! I am phasing out my really nice red towels that are just getting too old, and this time going for all white, so I spent some time looking at towels and their reviews.These are a bargain at under $9 a piece (at time of this review). I wanted the 27x54, which is a little larger than the red towels I have had for years. They are the perfect size.I washed them first in warm water and dried them on normal drying temperatures. There was some white fluff in the lint trap but I expected that. There is no lint on my body when I dry with them, nor any pilling. As well, if there was any shrinking, I didn’t notice or care, and the stitching/band didn’t draw up so you have that weird smaller ends—that’s a big plus for me as the white towels I bought a few years ago shrink at the stitching/band.Super super soft! And very absorbent.If these last for years, I’ll be so happy.I love them enough that I want to order 4 more, plus washcloths and hand towels—I was waiting to see if I really liked them first before I committed to more. And reading good reviews from those who have had them longer, I’m encouraged.For a reasonably-priced towel set of 4, these really soft comfy towels are worth it.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BO5XZWEMS1H1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YW41GDJ","B00HTB2XOO","Color: White"

The towels aren't bad, but they're not anything like the top quality, super plush towels you find at a great hotel or spa. They also aren't huge like some are insisting. They are regular sized bath towels. And they peel. One washing and they're already showing signs of peeling. You can get something very similar at Target for $7 each.
