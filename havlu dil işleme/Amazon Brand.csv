See Photos and Links.......","***Updated review.I purchased these towels in spite of the mixed reviews and pictures of damaged towels... One reason being the low $21.99 price point for the set of 6 towels, another being the slightly larger bath towels at 30""x 56"" (standard is 27x54).Also, I read reviews stating that the plum is slightly lighter than pictured and this is what I was hoping for. I figured they were worth a risk as I noticed the reviewers who noted the plum color didn't seem to have as many negative reviews.They arrived quickly and my husband and I both agreed that they appear to be thick and beautiful. That said, I can't yet comment on quality, in terms of longevity, but will be updating this review after a few months of use and numerous washes.I am very particular about how I launder clothing and the likes, so my findings will only really apply for others who do the same... I don't wash towels with jeans or other articles with zippers or anything that could snag them (or that the towels would wear down).I use Perwoll detergent for darks which preserves and renews dark colors beautifully (sold here on Amazon, pricey but a little goes a long way and its worth it) and I don't use detergents with regular fillers which buildup on clothes.     Lastly, I use wool dryer balls and do not use fabric softener (which especially shouldn't be used with towels since it leaves a coating on them, making them less absorbent).     I uploaded some pictures so you can see the plum. I laid out a couple of purple cardigans next to them that are more of a true purple or plum, for comparison. These are a slightly smokey plum (more plum than gray, just a touch more muted shade). Very plush, especially for under $22, and much prettier than expected!Definitely recommend, at the very least, for towels on display getting little use. No snags or poor quality apprearance upon arrival - from Pinzon seller via Amazon, in Plum.Happy shopping! Smile.*UPDATE* After first wash, no more dryer lint than with any other new towel set I've purchased. No fuzzies sticking to wet skin or shedding. Color and overall look is as good as new... More to come if anything changes...After a month of use, a number of washes and dryings, we are super happy with this set!  We will be ordering another set while we can (noticed the seperates in plum are no longer available and the HUGE bath mat in plum is now also gone- very plush!).

"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2016","Grandma Zizzy","yes","yes","Really liked these... until the washcloths started getting splotches all over them!","2/3/17 update:  For our whole adult lives, both my husband and I have had to pinch pennies, so we're hardly what you'd call ""towel snobs""... we had our two sets of ""good towels"" which were used only for company (and to dry off our grandkids during sleepovers - they're the most important ""company"" in our lives!), and then there were the towels we ourselves use... and have been using for eons!  But this year, I decided to splurge a bit in that area for my hard-working, blue collar hubby, googled ""Egyptian cotton towels"" (since I'd heard Egyptian cotton was the creme de la creme, with its longer, more dense threads/thread loops that pull moisture away from your body while trapping the warmth of that moisture at the same time) and this set of Pinzon towels popped up.  Seemed a pretty decent price for quality, so I went ahead and ordered a couple of sets for him - he's a big guy, and was thrilled to have these generously sized towels after a long day!  He could not care less about such things, but I loved the border designing.First, I wish I'd done a little more research before making the purchase.  Had NO idea that Amazon had started its own private label lines years ago, including this Pinzon label (bed & bath, table top kitchen tools/accessories, indoor furnishings)!  The others are Strathwood (outdoor furnishings/lighting), Pike Street (a ""value"" line of bed/bath), and Denali (tools/accessories), and apparently they made the move to try to give its customers great value at competitive prices.  I knew the GSM (grams per square meter) number was important when looking at towels (i.e. 300-400 are pretty thin/light weight, 400-600 are considered medium weight/thickness, while 600-900 are the super absorbent, thick and heavy feeling towels that you typically find in upscale hotels or spas.)  Since we don't often (NEVER!) frequent those types of places, I was pretty happy when I saw the 600 GSM number on these towels.  When I went to write my review, I happened to see Pinzon's LUXURY towels - an 820 GSM for not too much more!  Another thing to keep in mind when buying Egyptian towels is to make sure the label doesn't say ""made with"" Egyptian cotton... they also contain standard cotton and sometimes even polyester!  The label should say 100% Egyptian cotton - these do.  And I guess the other thing is that while Egyptian IS the ""cadillac"", Pima cotton is grown in America and creates a towel similar in GSM to Egyptian, and Turkish cotton is also a quality cotton - again, the key with all three (Egyptian, Pima or Turkish) is making sure it says ""100%"".I washed them a couple of times before using to get rid of the chemical smell and - while there was quite a bit of lint the first time around, there wasn't as much the second, and they certainly weren't falling apart as I'd read about in some of the other reviews.  HOWEVER... after my husband began using them, I started noticing white splotches on the wash cloths as I'd also read about in other reviews (though NOT on the hand or bath towels.)  We're now close to 2 months into use, with the wash cloths splotched all over the place but no splotches at all on the hand or bath towels!  As I was folding laundry yesterday and shaking my head over the splotches, it finally hit me.  My husband uses an astringent to clean his face of work grime when he gets home from work, using the wash cloths, so I believe it's one of the ingredients in the astringent that's reacting with the dye in the hand cloth!  Depending upon the type of soap/cleanser or laundry detergent other reviewers are using, I'm betting it could be a similar reaction.  But I'll tell ya - NONE of our old wash cloths reacted this way to his astringent, so whatever dyes they're using in the Pinzon plants much be pretty cheap.  Amazon's attempt to to give its customers ""great value at competitive prices"" should not mean taking shortcuts that don't allow a product to perform under typical usage!",2,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1340AOL53HGYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZKS","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Grey"

I feel like I just flushed my money down the proverbial toilet, but what I am really upset about is the waste of resources. Recycling is very important to me. I guess I can use them for rags or for my own use when I don't have guests around, but not for guest towels like I wanted to.I have bought Pinzon products in the past and enjoyed a certain level of quality. I read the reviews and they were mixed. So, I decided to give them a try, based on my past experiences with the Pinzon name. I thought that maybe they just got one bad towel. I will never buy Pinzon products again.For the cost the thickness and quality of the product appeared to good when I opened the package, little did I know that the towels had hidden issues I wouldn't see until later.These towels are one time use, they are just disposable and will fill a landfill somewhere. After one use and washing they are fading in small areas, turning orange. Clearly they not color fast. You can see the color fading in the photo. I used one set and washed it, every single one had the same issue. And I know that it isn't from leftover bleach from a previous wash or anything like that.

I washed the towels a couple of times, but it is permanently damaged. It seems to me that the dye is super poor quality. It should not change color when just wiping hands from having washed them with soap. Even if it gets a little bit of soap leftover on it, quality dye would not turn color instantly.

"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2019","Oakspear","yes","yes","Great Towels for the Money","I had been needing some new towels for a while. When I saw these towels on Amazon for a low price I was excited at first, but then I started reading the mixed reviews, which gave me pause. However, I decided to go ahead and give them a try anyway, and I'm glad I did so.These towels are soft to the touch, look great, and are very absorbent. They've held up well through multiple washings and I have yet to see any fading except for a couple of the hand towels (Which was expected; I'll come back to that later).After reading some of the other reviews, I noticed that a lot of people are upset with the amount of shedding from these towels. Here's the deal: Almost all towels are going to shed through the first few washings. I've had cheap towels from Wal-Mart and premium ones from Bed, Bath, & Beyond, and one thing they ALL had in common was that they shed like crazy through the first half-dozen or so washings. It just comes with the territory. Shedding doesn't mean that the towels are of poor quality; it's just something that towels do (in fact, I'd be worried about the long-term durability of towels that DON'T shed at first).Now, about the hand towels I mentioned earlier. I set aside a couple of the hand towels to use with my Proactiv acne treatments. Proactiv (and any other acne treatment that contains benzol peroxide) is going to make your clothes and towels fade. For that reason, I made it a point to buy a couple of extra hand towels and use them just for drying my face after I apply my treatment, as I knew they would probably fade badly as a result (and they did). The same has happened to every other set of towels I've owned, so I don't hold it against the towels themselves; it's just the effect that benzol peroxide has on fabric.Overall, I've very please with the quality of these towels. Another good bargain from Amazon.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P0EW29Q4RJCV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZGC","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Cocoa"

I immediately washed them, and when I pulled them from my washer, the inside of the washer was FILLED with wet lint (had to run a cycle to clean it).  Then into the dryer they went.  So much lint came off the towels that it was more than my dryer filter could handle.  I pulled the lint off and had larger than a facecloth size of towel remnants in my hand.  The lint was thicker than a roll of Scotch Tape, and longer than a soda bottle (see pictures).The good news is that, even after shedding more than a Siberian Husky in the Mojave Desert at Noontime in June, the towels look great.  They feel quite soft, and, after having been used the for the first time, are quite absorbent.I'd recommend these towels to anyone looking for a soft, absorbent set of true-to-color, bath set.

I never thought to read reviews of towels but I kind of regret that now. I did look at the stars which showed an average of 4 and while that might make me do further research for other kinds of products, it seemed acceptable for towels. Of course I pre-washed them before use and was amazed at the stunning amount of lint. First I washed them with some other towels. Those towels had so much lint stuck to them I had to wash and dry them again separately. I then rewashed and re-dried the Pinzon towels and wound up with another totally full lint filter (see photo 1). When I took the towels out of the dryer the 2nd time an abundance of fine 'towel dust' began to fall off the towels so I decided to wash and dry them again. I carefully put them back in the washer so I wouldn't have a layer of towel dust all over my kitchen. I washed them - without detergent of any kind - and dried them again. This time it looked as though the lint had been tackled, there was only ½ a filter full of lint (see photo 2). I had no problem with the towels unraveling but this time one of the hand towels had spots where the color came out of the towel (see photo 3). This towel will be used as a rag. Also, by this time the once soft towels felt coarse and uninviting. I decided to use the bath towel for my next shower to see if it was okay to use. It was indeed very scratchy. I'm going to try to bring back some of the softness with dryer sheets but if that doesn't work I will have at the end of this ridiculous process a $22 set of rags.

I couldn't find anything in the description of these towels that told what the GSM is, so I went totally off the shipping weight.  One 6-piece set (2 bath towels, 2 hand towels, 2 washcloths) weighs 4.3 pounds, which is fairly high for towels in this price range.  In comparison, the Amazon Basics 6-piece set is a couple dollars cheaper, but only weighs 3.2 pounds.  The Utopia set is an 8-piece set (comes with 4 washcloths), cost 5 dollars more, yet only weighs 3.85 pounds.I was impressed with the quality of the towels when they arrived.  I washed the towels before putting them out with a cup of vinegar to remove the protective coating that the towel makers put on towels and to help seal in the color to reduce future fading.  The towels came out of the dryer nice and soft and fluffy.  They have the appearance of a much more expensive towel.Are there better towels out there?  Yes, but for more money.  In my opinion, these are the best towels you'll find for the current price on Amazon of $21.99 per set.",4,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712922uYnBL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bQLKO7GOL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71f57+oAIZL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jXhIXYR+L.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wKEQF0W+L.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GcRsFYMOL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81a4ogNl5xL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTEAMDJMSO1PN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZEY","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Driftwood"

Otherwise, great towels for the price.Color fading issues: check your toiletries. Chances are they have chemicals in them that discolor fabrics. Benzoyl peroxide is one of the biggest culprits of this, which is found in face washes, astringents, and even body washes. By the way, this is such a wide-spread (regardless of quality) issue that there are towels made that are benzoyl peroxide-resistant. Whitening toothpastes do as well, as do mineral deposits in hard water.I don't know why so many people fly off the handle and leave a bad review without doing a minimal amount of research. I also don't know what some people are doing to their towels to have such damage to them after a couple of washes (holes in the middle of your towels? Seriously?). I do feel, though, that a lot of issues that people are complaining about are user errors - especially the discoloration.

I only ordered one pack due to the mixed reviews and I wanted to try them before ordering several. As soon as they arrived I opened the package and felt the material. I wasn't very optimistic, as I had the poor reviews in mind, they felt rough and yes as others said, like public pool towels. Thankfully, I continued with my trial, and put them through the wash- alone because new towels produce a ton of lint. Yes one towel ended up with one minor thread pull. As an aside, I've never had a new towel go through the wash and not have at least one thread pull. I'd be willing to bet that the reviewers whose towels shredded in the wash were either not this thread count, brand etc, or perhaps their washer was malfunctioning. I put them through the dryer three times, again alone due to lint factor, and cleaning the lint filter in between each dryer cycle and noted the first cycle it was nearly full, and each subsequent cycle produced less lint until the third produced barely any. They came out of the dryer soft, fluffy, sturdy and overall very pleasing. I used them to dry myself after my very next shower and again, they were very absorbant, which again makes me question if those reviewers who said they didn't absorb well were reviewing the wrong item in some way or maybe they didn't wash them first. There was also absolutely no transfer lint etc the towels were super soft and large wrapping my average height (7 months pregnant) body from chest to knees with plenty of room to spare. With these towels passing the test, I went ahead and ordered more, and gave them all the same treatment with the same results.

That's it led me to this product here and I found out after the 30-day. To return it because I only wash maybe once every 3 weeks and I wash these towels may be four to five times that the color on the edges have turned from Brown to orange or red so they're changing color and 2 they did not absorb water around the sink as when you put the towel down on the sink the wipe it up it pushes it and it doesn't absorb it and 3 when you use it to dry off you have to rub yourself over and over to get it to absorb water and then if you don't stick it up high up towards the ceiling where it's warmer it won't dry out in a 24-hour. If you put it down at about a five to six foot level and hang it.I would not recommend buying this product bases with a state because I don't believe this is true Egyptian cotton bass is all the information that I researched on and I'm very disappointed because I got no assistance or really caring about it and I bought three sets of these and it just wasn't a good deal because now I've got three sets at nothing so I use them for grease rags and I'll find a true company that handles Egyptian cotton towels.UPDATE: April 8 2019I've attached a picture also of the fadingof the product and this is not a quality towel as in my 60 years of being alive I've never seen a towel not absorb water.Also they turned a different color around the edges or throughout the towels like this one did and I'm showing but just one towel out of three sets of towels that I purchased for $75 total and I got a $25 credit is all and they're continuing selling these towels and I've also attached one photo to show that label as it only is 30% Egyptian cotton not one-hundred-percent so beware of buying a product like this that is not what I researched again and found out what Egyptian cotton can do.Nowadays with the majority of everything they're putting non quality and harmful ingredients are products in two items they're selling to the consumer that's very harmful and that's sad because they're doing that to everything this day and age.check everything out and if you can't find it under the description ask the seller or manufacturer and that's what I've been doing now because a lot of items don't give you the total picture all I want is a sale and the money for their back profit they don't care about somebody's personal welfare or help anymore it's repeat business.",1,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fNUquMyuL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XLn8C4GsL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRQE24I5VLRCS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZGC","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Cocoa"

"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2014","Cen Cal Reviewer","yes","yes","Terrible, terrible towels, and clearly NOT 725 GSM. The scale doesn't lie.","These towels are possibly the worst purchase I've ever made from Amazon -- and I've been a frequent customer since the days when all they sold were books.I bought FOUR sets of these awful towels, to replace four 6-piece sets of Lands End's Supima bath towels. The Lands End towels are okay, but I've had them for three years and they're a bit tired out. I was hoping to replace them with a slightly beefier towel.Here's why I bought these Pinzon towels from Amazon:1. They were advertised as being the same size as the Lands End towels. Indeed this is true. Both bath towels, for example, are 56 by 30.2. They were advertised as being a heavier weight than the Lands End towels. The Lands End towels are okay, at 650 GSM, but these were advertised as a somewhat beefier 725 GSM. NOT TRUE.How do I know it's not true? Because when I received the towels, I was a bit disappointed. ""Hm, I thought, they look and feel a bit thin. Perhaps they'll beef up in the wash. After all, Amazon says they are 725 GSM."" No, they did not beef up in the wash.So, I weighed one of my OLD Lands End 650 GSM 56x30 bath towels, and one of the NEW Amazon 725 GSM 56x30 bath towels. If Amazon's advertising is correct, their towel by definition MUST weigh more. In fact, a 56x30 bath towel is roughly a square meter. (A square meter = 1550 square inches, and a 56x30 towel is 1680 square inches, or 1.08 square meters.) My brand new towel, in other words, should have weighed about 81 grams more (75 grams x 1.08), or nearly 3 ounces more, than my tired old Lands End towel. And in fact, when you consider how much dryer lint I've cleaned over three years of washing the old towels, the difference should probably be even more than that.But did my brand new Amazon towel weigh 3 ounces more? NO. It weighed about half an ounce less. So it's more like a 600 GSM towel -- or less. Not cool, Amazon.3. The set was $19.99 versus about $37 (on sale) for a Lands End set. I guess you get what you pay for. Now see, I guess everyone knows that. However, I asked myself, ""How bad can a 725 GSM towel be? That's pretty beefy."" Too bad the advertisement is completely false and they didn't send me 725 GSM towels.So, in other words, my problem is not that the $19 towels turned out to be pieces of crap. My problem is that they were not 725 gram towels, so the ad was completely misleading.Also, after that first wash, there were runs in some of the towels, and strings everywhere. CHEAP HORRIBLE TOWELS. In fact, I took a sample picture to show you, but I'm not seeing a place to upload it.Don't make the same horrible mistake. I feel very ripped off.Amazon: Please stop calling these 725-gram towels, because they aren't. Please label them correctly. I never would have bought 500 or 600 GSM towels, or whatever these are.",1,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSW42JR6WDNTB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZDU","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: White"

But I didn't want that much fluff.  I have had super fluffy towels and while they feel nice, they are a PITA to wash, dry and hang because of the fluffiness.  I bought these to spite the negative reviews, noting that some people didn't wash according to instructions, and some people want different things out of a towel.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2019","ceedreamer","yes","yes","Amazon brand, Pinzon","I am the type of person, that once I purchase something and it worked for myself and my husband, I never, or rarely deviated from that product. Shopping for new towels after many, many years, the only shade of a color  I was searching for,  came up in the Pinzon line, which is the Amazon brand. Thought about ordering the towels that looked a shade or two off, as they were the name brands we had always purchased, when one of the big mall stores had a sale. It is difficult for both of us to go shopping at stores and malls as my better half has health problems, and I have become totally disabled. So, just going out to shop, is in our past. I have kept the household and us, running smoothly by shopping at Anazon, thus far. But this nagging feeling I had about changing the richness of the color scheme we have set ourselves up for in a bathroom that was redone,  in preparation for the last time in our lives, to redecorate had me worried. They LOOKED nice and fluffy, and MOST towels are very absorbent. But I have also seen towels in store advertisements that, once in the store, the product looks and feels, NOT as advertised. At times, it resembled nothing like the pictures and descriptions. So, after discussing it with my other half, we decided to ""take a leap"", for once and  go with Pinzon, Amazon's brand. I admit I worried about authenticity of both color and quality many times, as I awaited the delivery. Oh my! When they came, was I surprized! Not only did they all match perfectly, the QUALITY was beyond my expectations! They are thick, beautiful towels that are fluffy, wash beautifully and are so soft! On top of that, the color scheme matched perfectly! My other half even remarked about these towels, and he rarely says anything about a product,  unless he does not like it. So THAT in itself was a bonus. I have always opted for the ""other"" brand when choosing what to purchase on Amazon. After this experience, I will be ordering Pinzon towels for another bathroom, once we are done  re-doing things like paint and flooring. They happen to have another shade of a color, that will match another bath perfectly. From now on, I won't  be as rigid as to my choices of what we have liked and worked for us before. Amazon REALLY surprised me, in that not only did they come out with their own line of merchandise, but thus far it exceeded my expectations for quality! I have been ""sold""!",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIX2V8CZWB1H0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B007K6SPFY","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Moss"

This one also seemed to have a lot of pith balls on it, even after the first washing. Overall, the quality seems to be pretty good as far as density. Only time will tell how well it holds up.UPDATE:After four months, one of the towels developed a hole in the middle; not a tear, but a hole. It seems the woven fabric just came apart. I have bought other cheaper towels that held up more than 10 years before the edges started to fray. We are not hard on towels. The worst part is that once you are past the 30-day window for returns, THERE IS NO WARRANTY. There is absolutely no method of correction (unless you consider this review a ""correction""). I have not YET had any problems with the other towels, but is it just a matter of time? Unless you're willing to risk simply throwing your money away, I do NOT recommend these towels from Amazon.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2015","Wen","yes","yes","Good mid weight towels but linty...","I purchased this line of towels in the Moss and Wedgwood colors. Researched ""washing new towels"" and ended up washing them in warm water with detergent and white vinegar then detergent and baking soda. This is supposed to set the color and accelerate removing the coating that is put on new towels (which interferes with absorbency). I did this 4 times (drying in dryer after each wash). This process did seem to get rid of the coating and lint faster. BUT, the difference in the amount of lint generated by the moss set and the Wedgwood set was tremendous! The moss set shed barely a handful of lint thru the process but the Wedgwood set shed at least 6-7 large handfuls of lint ! (I also bought a Pinzon 550 GSM set in coral and had the same lint nightmare!).What I like: The colors! Which match the pics pretty closely.  The banding does not shrink.  They are soft and absorbent (after the washings).  Good quality mid weight towel.What I don't like: Lint!! Don't understand how in the world Amazon can say their towels won't shed much after the first wash.  The coating put on the towels.  One of the Wedgwood hand towels came apart at the side seam after first wash.  The corner of one of the Moss bath towels was not sewn down completely.Overall: I like these mid weight towels, would purchase again and think they are priced right.I suggest Amazon should include instructions for the initial washing process of their towels (with the vinegar, wash/dry frequency, etc.). Customers would have a more favorable view of their towels if they had a more positive, quick, and less annoying experience with getting rid of the lint and increasing the towels' absorbency.But what I REALLY wish is that some brilliant Research & Development person will think to market towels that are sold without a coating and already defuzzed!!

"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2015","Objective Subjective","yes","yes","Disappointed with the current sets","Two years ago when we first ordered these, we thought of them as a best buy and a great value, as they were thick and thirsty and soft. Far better than towels at the major department stores that sold for twice as much at their so-called 50% Off sales. So, we ordered several more sets recently. We are very disappointed with the current sets from Pinzon. From the start and even after five washings, these new ones have not ""thickened"" and they are not at all ""thirsty"". They still soft, but softness alone doesn't cut it if you need more than one bath towel to dry yourself after a shower. Softness alone doesn't cut it if the hand towel feels ""wet"" after one use. So, 3 stars because at this price, they are just ""OK"". I would have to say these are now only as good as the low-end department store towels which sell for 4.99/3.99/2.99 (bath/hand/finger) when they are 50%off. Add that up and you get the Amazon price. We won't be buying these again. By the way, we have noticed many reviews which claim these towels shed too much and unravel easily. In both our old sets and these new ones, this has not happened. Face it, any new towel is going to create a lot of lint in your dryer for the first 2 or even 3 washings, but after that lint production is minimal.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ93W2Y1EHB6A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZFI","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Cream"

When I was revamping one of the bathrooms, I finally decided to take the plunge, despite all the warnings about how these towels shed.First of all, the color really is true to what you see here. The other thing I'd notice is that the towels seem very thin. I was initially disappointed, but I knew I'd wash them first before I used them.Well, I can honestly say that anyone who says they shed is not pulling your leg. Whoa! A ton of lint in the washer lint trap and another ton in the dryer trap! I wondered if there'd be any towels left after all the lint was gone.I used the towels, which were a big meh. Thin and lots of lint. But what's interesting is that after a few washes and dryings, the towels seem to have plumped up.I was just folding the bath towel downstairs, and damn, it really was nice and full and fluffy. All the towels in the set got a lot nicer the more I washed and dried them.The lint is less but still prodigious in the dryer. The color has stayed true. The towels are very roomy and haven't shrunk.I know that different colors in towels react different ways, and who knows? Maybe I got in on a good lot and newer ones won't react as well.But I'd say for $20, it was a good investment - they are pretty, absorbent, and plump towels. So try a few washes and dryings before you make up your mind. You might be pleasantly surprised.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B1FE57ZO8FFH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B007K6SOTQ","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Plum"

The bottom of the washer was coated with a thin layer of maroon threads and tufts, and both the towels and washcloths were visibly shedding threads when they came out to go to the dryer. They came out of the dryer nice and fluffy, but the towel and face cloth edges were frayed and shedding more threads and tufts.

Not as much lint as I thought there would be and the color didn't fade from their original condition. I haven't seen any fuzzies after getting them damp from using them post-shower/post-hand washing.

I wish I had known this because after I'd wash my face I'd dry it with the towels and now they are all bleached. I used all kinds of face washes to see what would happen and all of them bleached them. Kind of a pain since that's what they are there for. Again, as long as you know this, maybe they will be okay.

I wanted to get a lot of extra washcloths that matched the set, but I could not find them on Amazon.  I ended up buying a bundle of 24 washcloths that seem to be from the same manufacturer, but the look was not identical.-- enough fuzz came out of them from the first run in the dryer that I think something must be wrong.  If it keeps up there will be no towel  left.  The reviews mentioned this problem, but almost no one said the towels eventually fell apart.-- the Amazon page said these were made in Turkey, but some of the towels say made in Indian and others say made in Pakistan.-- I saw 3 variations  across the 20 sets I bought.  1)  most of the towels are bright white, but about 6 sets had ""almost bright white"" towels.  They are supposed to be identical, but when the bright white ones are next to the other ""matching"" towels, the other ones look a little dirty.  This means the manufacturer(s) are not paying attention to product consistency.  2)  We also had inconsistent sizing.  A group of sets had handtowels that were about 1/2 inch different in size, for no particular reason that I could see.  Again -- manufacturer doesn't pay attention to consistency..  3)  Tags tags tags.  Some towels had shiney silky sown in tags.  Some had paper tags.  Some had just one tag.  Other towels had 2 tags per towel.  I had to cut off the paper tags because they would have made a mess in the washer, and I wanted to cut off the silky cloth tabs because they were  way too big.  So I spent more than an hour cutting of an estimated 70 tags.  Ug.Based on what I know so far, I would buy them again.

I went to a local store and they wanted $10-$20 per each good towel so I got these. I love them sure there might be a better towel, sure there might be a higher quality towel, but these are great quality for a great price. I recommend following the care instructions and wash all of them all together in a solo wash. There was some color bleed but you would not wash a new red shirt with your white load now would you? It was as expected and there were a few solo threads that came out, like 2 threads on one or two of the six towels. I cut them off and no problem since. I actually think I 'm going to get another set in another color. I use to work in the 3rd best golf course in my state and they had really nice high quality towels and these almost come close to them...almost.Update 9/22/17 I have since bought a 2nd set I now own the grey set. I remodeled my bathroom and they grey towels are the perfect match. I originally bought the navy. I think the grey look a bit nicer and since they match my new bathroom I'm pretty stoked. Final thoughts I still love them. Navy has lost a little bit of fluffy feel but still feel like a good high quality towel. I get compliments on the hand towel in my bathroom. There's a bit of lint the first few washes but it goes away and one or two strands that I cut out of both sets. I bought navy because I love blue and I read in the reviews the color fades. Well my navy has lost no color in about 1 years time.My concern with the grey is it's lighter than the navy and I have some light color towels that you can see stains. If I have any problems with the grey set I'll post it here.Update 5/19/18I bought the plum color towel set as a gift for someone because they always comment how nice my hand towel is in my bathroom...They love they towels and is all they use now. I've had the navy for almost 2 years and they still look new. My grey set is still like a new set of towels no fade, still has new fluffy feel. All 3 sets that I have purchased had the same upfront issues of 1) You need to wash all of them together in a separate load because there is a first wash bleed. 2)  There are loose strands and lint after they come out of the dryer, I use toenail clippers to remove the strands, and after a few times through the wash it will stop...I honestly forgot about the strands until I was rereading this review. 3) There are tags on every towel that are easily able to rip off.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVCIILCCY35JW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B007K6SPWM","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Navy"

I have also purchased Pinzon towels with a much higher weight (725 and 820 grams) and I actually prefer these less expensive towels -- the heavier weight towels get so thick that it seems they repel water, rather than absorbing it. To me, this weight of towel is just about right: it is thick enough to be luxurious but it still absorbs water well (which, of course, is a towel's basic job). But the main thing I notice after all these years is the value for the money. These are amazingly well priced!

"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2015","Kevin Boulder","yes","yes","Initially liked but would now discourage anybody buying after half a year of ownership.","I struggled with giving these a 4 or 5 star review. I'm afraid my ignorance of how any towel might perform when washed is giving it an unfair ""ding"" when, for all I know, any new ""Egyptian cotton"" fabric would behave the same way.Just be careful after the first wash. I bought two sets of these and threw everything into the wash. That means, 4 large towels, 4 hand towels and 4 wash cloths. Per the care instructions, I tumble dried them on low heat. This takes forever but it's fine. After the drier shut off the first time, I opened the door and nearly got a face full of lint It had spilled over the lint catcher and there was a bunch still shoved up in the door where it sucks it in before sending down to the lint catcher. So... first round, approximately two entire lint catchers full of lint. But they weren't even dry yet. Turned it on for another round. About 45 minutes later, still not quite dry yet but another catcher full of lint and still a touch damp. So, third round, went to bed.In the morning, pulled them out fully dry along with yet ANOTHER catcher full of lint with a little bit still stuck up in the door. So, do a set of two and expect somewhere between 3-4 lint catchers full of lint. In other words, keep an eye on it and empty the lint catcher frequently.As for the quality of towels apart from the sick amounts of lint on the first wash, they seem really nice. Heavy, absorbent, nice color, nice feel and they didn't shrink very much at all. I wish I could give them a 4 and a half rating instead of 4 because I just don't know how common shedding that much lint should be on the first washing. Again, it was two sets so expect half that much for one set. But for the price... WORTH IT.Update: so after the first wash and the results I mention above, I had one full size towel, one wash cloth and one hand towel all hanging in the bathroom for several days. I noticed that the towels continue to ""emit"" fibers and I was cleaning this lint off of the toilet tank (towel rack hangs above it), the baseboards and the floor. I imagine it's going to take one or two more washings before I see a drop-off in the amount of stuff shedding off of these towels.Update two: after several months of ownership, these things still love to shed lint. I figure at this point, it's going to be a good year of multiple washings before they stop leaving a linty mess all over the bathroom floor. I might bump them down to an unofficial 3 star in this update but I'll probably leave it officially on 4 stars. They are decent towels and will eventually be great when they stop leaving a mess.Update three: the towels are still ""emitting"" lint and fiber so many months later. I'm not even sure now I consider them safe with all this stuff floating around in the air. For the longest time, I couldn't figure out why a ring of grey was appearing around the water line in my toilet several days after each cleaning. It wasn't the usual pink or other film that appears as it progresses to needing a cleaning. I finally realized it was fiber from the grey towels hanging on the rack above the toilet. Just, unbelievable how much and for how long these things shed. They still continue to overwhelm my dryer's lint screen after dozens of washings. So now it's officially a 2 star review when I initially debated 4 or 5 when they first arrived. I'd rather discourage anybody buying these towels at this point.",2,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W9JD7VY3RSHQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZKS","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Grey"

It's too bad really because they we're very nice towels as far as thickness and absorbency.

There are tons of choices with advertised GSM weights from 300 to 900 and prices all over the place like the weights.  The marketing touts Turkish cotton, Egyptian cotton, and others.I ended up ordering these Amazon Pinzon branded towels, 3 sets each in green and white.  The 600 GSM weight seemed like a good balance of weight and price.  And I liked the colors.I was a little concerned by reviews that said they were ""too thin"" or ""cheap"" but those are subjective things.  If you're used to 900 GSM spa towels yeah, they may seem thin.  But I decided to give them a try.The instructions said to give them an initial wash and they will fluff up.  I found that to be true.  They are packed pretty tight and looked compressed right out of the bag.  But after a wash and dry, they fluffed up and feel really nice.As for being ""thin"" or ""cheap"", they seem very nice to me.  Personally, I don't like super heavy towels.  Like everything else this GSM weight thing can be taken to extremes.  I think there's a balance point between a towel that's easy to handle and one that feels like you're grabbing a rug.  Also I've found that the really heavy weight towels don't necessarily dry me off any better or faster than a mid weight towel like these.  And those big thick towels can be hard to hang over a towel bar.At the end of the day, I think Amazon spec'd these towels pretty well when you consider weight, feel, looks, performance, and price.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16NSQ72HYNSDQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B007K6SPFY","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Moss"

I then dried them on delicate setting twice which is low heat. At least two of the items have pulled threads. I looked these over fairly closely when opening so I know this happened in the wash. I took a second look at target towels and I think these are comparable with what they carry now - in terms of initial looks and feel. Most of my existing towels have pulled threads now, but I know it wasn't after the first wash. So disappointed because I thought I had scored such a great deal. Still a good price if you receive a set without the issue so I am hesitantly giving a second star. I'm returning all of mine - I'll pay more for better.***original review***These were on special for $5 off when I bought the set - I bought 3 sets. And I'm not disappointed. They seem plenty big - bigger than expected, but I was hoping for fluffier towels. These aren't bad at all - they are way better than anything local at this price point. But they don't compete with towels that you'll pay $20 each.  One can dream, right?  But they'll dry quicker and they are plenty hefty for the price I paid. I don't know what the big deal is with Egyptian cotton. They seem like ordinary cotton to me but again they are nice towels. They are nicer than the towels they replace that came from target. All towels shrink 3 or 4"" so I expect these will also. Out of the package these aren't the softest - I suggest washing them first. These probably deserve 5 stars because they are such a great value but I struggle with Egyptian cotton supposedly being better and I can't tell it is anything special.",2,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YCBASNY0O6KO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZFI","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Cream"

They still look brand new, we have had them three months now.. I was impressed with both the thickness and size of the towels and wash cloths.

Over 45, wife, two kids in college, I have never before seen such a fragile group of towels.  A year later not one matches the other, we got 8 sets, and two have lost their edge binding completely.  You would think we have a vicious laundry machine or that we mistreated the towels from Amazon, when in fact, due to their poor performance we handled them with more consideration than any common-use towel should receive.The rub is simple, it takes time for the flaws to appear, it does not matter what type of washer-dryer we have only used HE machines with no agitator.

During unpacking, I was very pleased with the initial looks of all the pieces along with the packaging. This would make a very nice wedding or any occasion gift. I washed them with a few other of my towels. There was quite a bit of ""cotton"" in the dryer vent filter. It was pristine lint, I could have used for cotton balls. LOL. But I threw away. I bought the white towels by the way too. After the wash/dry, the towels, hand towels and wash clothes were still flat to fold (the corners didn't draw up or the edging either), soft, and fluffy. They seem to me to be the middle of all on weight, thickness, softness, fluffiness. This is how I love my towels, but others want different things. I will be ordering more.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2015","Sue Too","yes","yes","You get a bit more than what you paid for","For $22 you are getting two bath towels, two hand towels and two face cloths.  Let's face it...for that price you aren't going to get super-high quality.  That being said though, I am quite impressed with what $22 will get you with these towels.After renovating one bathroom I bought two sets of the navy blue towels figuring that they would not be used very often so why not give them a shot for that price?  While renovating the second bathroom I used the new towels and LOVED the size and absorbency of the bath towels so much (more like a bath sheet size) that I ended up buying two sets of the cranberry for the second bathroom.I was a bit disappointed that the cranberry bath towels were a little smaller than the navy blue ones, but still larger than average.  I have seen complaints that the hand towels and face clothes are a bit larger from some other reviewers but I didn't really find that to be the case with my set, so apparently the sizing depends on the lot you end up purchasing.The colors are rich and have held up well after several washings.  The navy is a true navy blue and the cranberry leans a bit toward the burgundy side with a hint of red which is fine with me since I really wanted burgundy anyway.  I have only seen one or two very tiny pulls out of the entire four sets.  I cannot attest to whether or not the colors ran upon the first (or subsequent) washings since I always wash them separately from other items.  There was quite a bit of ""fuzz"" in the lint trap after the first couple of washings but I think that is pretty typical of any new towels.Will these towels hold up after five years?  Probably not.  But find me anything you paid $22 bucks for that you actually got five years out of.  In five years I'll probably be redoing the bathrooms again anyway and will want a different color.I give this product five stars, based on quality for the price.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S7EFZOSBZXCM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B007K6SO82","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Cranberry"

We were thrilled to find that these are beautiful, thick towels. I saw some comments about lint. So far the only real heavy lint I've seen was in the recommended prewash where I emptied the lint trap twice during drying. There was some lint in the bottom of the washing machine after first wash also. However, the towels washed beautifully, no fading, and dried normally. They are very soft and the bath towel is bigger than the bath towels that came with our other sets. I went back and purchased a second set and will probably buy some more.

However, the hand towels and washcloths are not quite as impressive, and seem a little thin.

My niggling complaint has nothing to do with the quality, but the color description: the so-called ""cream"" color I bought really isn't cream to my eyes --  more like a light beige. Still looks nice, but not quite what I was expecting. Still, no complaints at this price, and color is subjective, after all.

I have been using them every day for three years, and they've held up extremely well to regular use. Also, I can confidently say that they don't require any special care. I'm not the type of person who follows tag instructions when laundering things, and that seems to have had very little impact on these towels over the last three years.They have a really well-balanced texture that you typically have to pay much more for in retail stores. It's strong enough to dry well, but soft enough that it doesn't feel abrasive. This is particularly important to me because I have very sensitive skin. Hotel towels feel like sandpaper to me. I've actually taken to packing these when I travel.There are softer, and more luxuriant towels out there. These are not perfect. The cost/benefit ratio is certainly in their favor, however.

But after the first wash and dry, it did come unraveled from the sides, which brought disappointment being I paid $10 a towel. I figured out why this is. They are not preshrunk, after you wash it, it shrinks but the thread they use does not shrink.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2013","Rick Longstreth","yes","-","Disappointed In Tennessee...","These towel sets are marginally acceptable. I ordered mine a couple of weeks ago and this is my opinion of them:1) Bath towels were not oversized by my standards. I've had ""oversized"" bath towels and these are simply standard size. The washcloths and hand towels are both larger than standard towels but the bath towels are not.2) The absorbency of the towels is no better or worse than any other towels that I have owned. Actually, several years ago I purchased a different set of Egyptian cotton towels and to this day they are FAR more absorbent than these sets.3) I am still waiting to see when the lint stops coming off the towels. I expect that the initial wash and maybe a few days thereafter, will produce small pieces of fiber falling off and onto the floor or shower, but it's been 2 weeks now and the lint balls continue.4) One of the hand towels has been washed twice now and after the second wash one side of the towel has begun to fray. The seam is already coming unraveled.CONCLUSION:I purchased these on sale and the price was decent. However, if I wanted so-so towels I would have gone to one of the local ""box-stores.""

They are wonderfully soft towels that look great in his bathroom...and fell great when used.So far, we've washed them about 5 times and the color has held up nicely.  They also still feel soft and fluffy after the washings.I like these so much I think I'm going to order him some more of them in a month or so...that way we'll end up with four big towels.  To be honest, we really don't use the little ones or the wash cloth very much (use loofas in the shower)...so the smaller towels that came with this set actually ended up being used in the kitchen, where they are great.I know families probably get a use out of the smaller towels and wash cloths and stuff...but I think this set was a nice price for just our using the two big blue towels.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N8KVPVJC491P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZJ4","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Wedgewood"

Usually, as I am a poor art graduate, purchase lower price point towels. So, with that, I do not have super big expectations. I gambled with purchasing towels over the internetz and was really happy I chose to go with these. I think they are as good of quality as you can expect for the price range. They are large, soft and absorb well. They are not super thick and fluffy but they are thick enough to be sturdy and absorbent and still soft.They are holding up well since I got them in January and I haven't noticed any significant fraying or wearing away yet. The color has held up well too, but I use only cold water in the wash. I'm sure there has been some minor fading but I have not noticed anything to the point to make me upset or feel ripped off. To be honest, unless something catastrophic happens to any of these in the next couple months, I'll be returning to Amazon to stock my towel sets!

After washing the towels the 1st time, I was left with a washer full of lint. I shook the towels out & my floor ended up covered in lint. So much lint was still visible on the towels, I decided to wash them a 2nd time & added to my linty mess. I was very frustrated at the mess but decided to go ahead & put them into the dryer.I cleaned my dryer's lint filter 3 times during the 1st drying cycle! I had never seen that much lint - thick enough to be a blanket - in my dryer filter.  I ran them through a 2nd drying cycle, and found a ""normal"" amount of lint to be on the dryer filter. I must admit I almost gave up on these towels during these initial washings & dryings and I worried there wouldn't be anything left of them whenever I finished. I also worried these towels would leave lint stuck all over me whenever I dried off with them but they have not.After getting through the initial Lint Hell Phase, I have been very pleased with these towels. I have found them to be large, very soft, and super absorbent. In my opinion these are a good purchase. Just remember the initial washing & drying prior to use will be a mess!

I washed them before using and they came out nice and fluffy. I gave them a 4 because the fabric has a strange feel next to the skin, I can't really describe it, except it's not that soft, snug cotton that cushions you...hard to explain. I'm hoping with more washes it will come around.I had to come back to edit my review. After 6 months, the silky, plastic feeling that I couldn't really describe earlier has still not gone away. The towels have held up well, however, I have to admit, I don't reach for them first when I grab a towel from the linen closet, since I prefer the feeling of real cotton. Another poster said theirs had the same feel and were made in China. Mine are made in Pakistan. Clearly, the product is not consistent, as can be understood when reading the reviews. So many people complain of thin towels that frayed, shed and faded after just a few washes.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2014","Lisa A","yes","-","Great value for the price","I ordered these towels in 4 different colors along with a boatload bedding, because I suddenly had 5 extra people coming to stay. I really just needed to cover the bases so I wouldn't run out, and I tried to coordinate towels with bedding sets.I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  I ran them through the wash to get them nice and soft, and everything was great.  I washed darks together, and the cream, which is more like a lovely butter yellow separately.  Yes, there was a bunch of lint I kept clearing from the dryer, but after all was said and done, they are fine towels for the price.Oddly enough, the thickness varies from color to color, and from size to size, but none are embarrassing.  The hand towels are thinner, which is okay with me for a guest situation.  The thickest were the plum color, which are a lovely, rich shade of amethyst.  The moss and Wedgewood are pretty too.

One of the hand towels completely turned to shreds in the wash!  The others didn't fall apart, but they surly no longer looked new.  (I have some towels that are over 10 years old that are holding up better.)On a good note, Amazon customer service was stellar as usual and told me to return the towels for a full refund.Perhaps this was just a bad batch, I don't know, but I was disappointed with the quality of the towels.",2,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FJ92SVVC0CAS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZEY","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Driftwood"

I expected a great deal more color loss since it is such a rich, dark color but the bleeding was minimal in my opinion as was the lint.  They stayed intact, dried beautifully and are a terrific value for the price.  I don't like extra-thick, heavy towels that take forever to dry and these are perfect, an excellent weight, lovely rich color...as far as I'm concerned there is nothing to not like about them. I have no regrets at all about this purchase.  I would recommend them and buy again.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TP6N5XU0TPPD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZGC","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Cocoa"

They are just as nice as towels that I've paid three times as much for: thick, luxurious, and generous in size. I paid more for a set at Walmart that weren't half as nice. The color is a true navy, so that's a nice plus. And having them arrive in two days so they could be in the bathroom for Thanksgiving company was such a plus! Recently, I read that new towels should be washed with a cup of vinegar the first time to remove a protective coating and make them more absorbent, so that's what I did. I also dried one set at a time, as there is often quite a lot fo lint on new towels these days--especially those made of Egyptian cotton.

I was excited so I washed them immediately so I could put them in my guest bath. After the wash I was a bit nervous because some threads had already come loose. After drying them I noticed my lint slot was packed full of white lint!!! I was surprised at how much was in there! I clean it before each load so it was only from the towels. While folding the towels I noticed there was still lint on them and it looked like it was snowing when I shook them to get it off. The towels look wonderful hung up although they seem harder than I imagined, especially since it said Egyptian cotton. The label actually says its 100% cotton and 100% Egyptian cotton loops...I'm not sure what that means but it doesn't seem like the entire towel is 100% Egyptian cotton.

One other thing- there were no hanging threads on any of the towels and the seams on the towels are very nice & sturdy.

So, I ordered a set some time ago and they are great quality for such a low price.  I won't hesitate to buy more of them as the need arises.  The first couple times of washing them will cause a lot of lint in the dryer, so it is recommended that half way through drying to clear the lint trap.  After the 3rd drying, the lint is more normal.  They are still as soft and fluffy as when they were new, so the lint issue does not lessen the quality of the towels.  The color was what I was hoping to see.  The white ones can be bleached and not lose quality.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2016","Alicein Wonderland","yes","-","Great Value","We purchased numerous sets of these towels for our AirBNB and are incredibly pleased at the value and the quality for the price. They shed a lot the first time I washed them, but less the second, and hardly at all now when I wash them. At first I was concerned with how fast/how well they would dry after use, it seemed to take a long time, but after a few times of washing them, they seem to dry a lot quicker now. This is the best value I could find for towels, even compared to Walmart or stores like TJ Maxx/Home Goods - they couldn't beat this price. My biggest ""complaint"" (if it can be called that) is too many hand towels! I suppose someday we'll be thankful for having so many. I also like that these were available on Prime Now in our area.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXJC3E6DO6WHN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZKS","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Grey"

I haven't washed them so I can't comment on them falling apart but, so far out of the box they are fine. I didn't really have the highest expectations for these because of the price.

Most towels unfortunately start smelling after a couple of months, even the very pricey ones, and I also find everything I tried so far not absorbent enough. I ordered a red set and my friend ordered a blue one and now both of our bathrooms are pretty much ruined because they shed so much. Even after washing them 3-4 times, it is still really bad (not to mention what they do with the dryers). The tub, the heating system and the fan grate - they're all red.

I washed them first and dried them about 4 or 5 times as recommended by other reviews. They did produce A LOT of lint but that didn't bother me... they're new towels after all. The pulling that I saw others complain about was there but it was minimal, so that didn't really bother me either.

The feel is fine, but quality control is lacking. They threw off almost two large dryer traps of lint and left link throughout the washer. While I assume that this will drop off, I was more disturbed by the fraying of the edges, several of which I had to cut off on three of the six towels. One was almost a foot long. It appears that either the edge binding is not sewn far enough over the center material or that a larger binding is needed. Also, a few center pulls appeared, even though the towels were washed and dried by themselves so had nothing to catch on.

Let them soak till the water is cool. Repeat. Then let them set in cold water. Squeeze excess water out and put them in the dryer on medium setting. Permanent press is the best.

I purchased them quite some time ago, and they were well worth the money.They are true to color, and nice and fluffy.The only downside that I found, is that I feel that the washcloths were much larger than they need to be.  They do not seem to be really usable.  I tend to prefer a lighter type of washcloth.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2013","Danny Parker","yes","-","Towels feel great and good size, too but bad when laundering","I liked these towels and they felt substantial when I used the large bath one.  Most towels do a good job of getting you dry but I noticed these ones do absorb the water well - you don't feel like your towel is getting damp as you finish drying yourself like some towels can.I picked these towels because other Reviewers thought they were also good value and I am sick and tired of the cheap crap you sometimes get in the stores.  It really is a case of paying for what you get.  Most towels look nice and plump on the shelves in the beginning, so I was pleased to see the laundering didn't break their texture and softness after washing.  WARNING: Be careful not to wash these with other colors, though, as they shed lots of fluff and contaminate other items in the load!I'd recommend these towels to anyone who does not want to spend a fortune but at the same time wants a reasonable quality set and some durability.  For families or roomies, you can get different colored sets, so there's no fighting over whose towel belongs to who.  I will update the review if I notice something else as I continue to use them.UPDATE: March 2014. I purchased the towels described above in two colors, Cream and Burgundy. Unfortunately, the Burgundy towels are also made by Pinzon but are described on each Towel Label as ""Egyptian Cotton Loop"" and they are absolutely dreadful. They shed constantly and after 3 months and maybe 6 washes, they shed red fluff everywhere - even when they are being used in the bathroom. I just pulled them out of the Washer and they have covered red speckles all over the other laundry items, especially black and blue items. For God's sake, stay away from these crappy Burgundy ""Egyptian Loop"" towels. Sorry to anyone who may have been fooled by my rosy review above - the review above still holds true for the Cream colored Towels, or if you wash the burgundy towels with no other colored items in the same wash.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA4IX4ZDNE2E8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B007K6SO82","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Cranberry"

I don't think you can find a better value anywhere, especially not at this quality. They are not overly soft, which I prefer in a towel, as it makes them more efficient when it comes to drying. I ordered the purple set, and about the only thing I can say negative is that the color is slightly different than online. The online images seem like a more royal or blue-purple, and in fact they are a bit lighter and more of a plum color (but still a very nice color and the difference is very slight). Even my fiance commented that he liked the set a lot, and we will be buying a second one (probably the black ones) at some point!

Being thicker and more luxuriant fabric they do not dry as fast as thinner towels. If you want a fast drying towel buy something cheaper and thinner.

"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2014","Sheila","yes","-","Returning customer for 2years","I've been buying these towels for a while now.  I learned after the first time tho, that you'll get covered in fuzz drying off with them at first when they're new.

Then this week I started to notice they were turning ORANGE in a few places.  I don't use bleach on my towels or to clean my bathroom so I was puzzled, but decided to be more careful.  I looked at both the hand towel and washrag today and it looks like they are tye-dyed orange (just in time for Halloween).  Either my hand soap, Noxema, or possibly toothpaste are reacting with the color.  So now my new towels are going to be banished to the back of the linen closet.

I needed some towels for an RV & thought I would order some cheaper ones because if they accidentally got left or ruined somehow while camping, it wouldn't break the bank.  I am happy to say I will be purchasing more of these towels for our home.  They are GREAT!  The color is vibrant (I got Wedgewood), they are thick & plush & as absorbent as the more expensive ones I usually buy. The sizes are wonderful, I haven't seen any shrinkage or fraying of the fabric.  I read other reviews about excessive lint, I really didn't see an increase in the amount of lint than with any other new towels.  I can't say anything negative about these towels.  I would highly recommend these towels.

I ordered a set in white a few weeks ago, washed them, dried them, and they held up great.  They are thick and soft and really nice.  They didn't shed any lint on me, however there was some in the dryer.  I can't tell you how pleased I was to see how well they held up after laundering.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2014","MiamiTechnoLawyer","yes","-","Great Towels, Superb Value.","I ordered these towels (725 Gram Pinzon) and another product Luxury Hotel & Spa Bath Towel 100% Genuine Turkish Cotton towels (4 towel bath towel set for just under $40) at the same time.  I was very satisfied with both purchases.  Luxury Hotel towel is a little softer and a feels slightly heavier despite the similar gram counts.  Both towels are the same length.  The Pinzon towel is 4 inches wider.  At $19.95 this 6 towel set is a superb value, I figure you are paying $6.00 each for the bank towels, $3.00 each for the hand towels, and $1.00 each for the wash cloths.  The Pinzon was the less expensive to the two products compared.Is this the thickest, softest, nicest towel I have ever touched.  No.  If you visit Bloomingdales, Saks, or Nordstom you can find a marginally better bath towel but you will pay $20.00 to $30.00 for it.  The Pinzon is better than anything you will find at Target or Lands End, and similar stores for two to three times the price ($12 to $18 a bath towel).  I have no idea why there are any 1 or 2 star ratings for this product the debate in my wind was whether to give this a 4 star or 5 star rating.  After trying out a test package I have already ordered more.  If I was giving this category grades I would grade as follows:  Softness A-, Size A, Weight A-, Quality A-, Value A+.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WIAR0A4LUGSW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B002S52ZDU","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: White"

"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2015","CS","yes","-","I've never gotten good or bad feedback from the recipients but I was ...","I bought one set of these because I've bought them a few times as gifts.  I've never gotten good or bad feedback from the recipients but I was looking for a new set for my home and liked the design and color choices.  I was worried because I saw a lot of bad reviews about them falling apart in the wash.I selected the moss color.  When I got them in the color was just too dark for what I was looking for and they felt scratchy so they sat unopened for the longest time.  I ended up going to a local store and getting what I wanted in a thicker but cheaper towel.  When I brought the new ones home from the store I put them in their first wash with a cup of white vinegar and nothing else and then dried them without any softener.  I was in love and very happy with my towels until...  I decided to just go ahead and wash the Pinzon set in white vinegar and no softener.I begrudgingly have to admit I was wrong and now my husband has claimed them for himself.  The ones I bought locally are thick and soft but they more push the water around your skin than absorb.  I don't mind because I like large and soft towels especially to wrap my hair in.  The Pinzon towels came out great from that first wash and softened up well.  The difference is that they are a brisk towel that dry your hair and body fast.  Very no nonsense which appeals to my husband.I've held off reviewing because I wanted to have a ton of washes in to be able to securely review the quality.  I originally purchased the towel on right around Christmas, it's now February 25th.  There's not been one busted seam, no picks, no holes, no tears and no fading so far.  I typically cram as many clothes into my washer as it can hold which to no end annoys my husband who is more of the type to fill it 3/4s of the way full.  We have front loaders, not sure if that would make a difference.  I will come back in a few months if anything changes but so far so good.  Hope it keeps that way.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R308BA24W6U08J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI","B007K6SPFY","Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Moss"
