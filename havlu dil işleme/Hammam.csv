They came with a set of luxury hotel towels I recently purchased.I actually ordered these washcloths for decoration. I wanted some plush washcloths to roll and place in a basket in my bathroom. These certainly filled the bill. They fluffed up when I washed them, I rolled them, arranged them in the basket, then placed 4 white and 1 pale blue puffs at the bottom. They look like something on TV or in a magazine. Now if I have overnight guests, I can offer them one of them and they'll think I pamper myself like this all the time. These are really nice washcloths, well stitched and strong while remaining soft. They are thick enough to be plush, but thin enough to be usable. I can't stand a cloth that is too thick.  The washcloths are perfect for my bathroom d√©cor, they are versatile, and I never have to worry about linting. I recommend them highly, and the price is so reasonable for 6 nice washcloths.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJK2IOQQLUVOM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SLR3T9F","B07SLPPZ6Q","Size: 4 Piece Washcloth Set | Color: Cool Grey"

She usually shops at a big box store and brings home designer brand towels.  Don't get me wrong, they are very nice but very expensive.

I chose Hammam, held my breath and pushed the Buy button.  They arrived quickly (thank you Prime) and to my untrained eye, they appeared to be very nice quality.  I popped them into the washer as per the recommendations on the packaging and anxiously waited to try them out the next day.  WOW, they are great!

"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2020","Samuel Williams","yes","yes","Honestly: Spa luxury and quality - description doesn‚Äôt lie","Bought this set of 4 bath towels and set of 6 hand towels.  I‚Äôve traveled to Europe, northern Africa and Southwest Asia - and these towels hold up to the ‚Äúspa‚Äù claim.  While they are relatively thin (consistent with most non-American hotels), that does NOT sacrifice softness nor absorbency (very surprisingly).  I have towels double the thickness from Target but they don‚Äôt absorb the water as well.  Plus, once you wash them, they fluff up, each time.  There is a little ‚Äúshedding‚Äù at first, but that is natural.  But what really shows the quality of this product is that at the middle of the end of the bath towel, there is a substantial sown-in loop so you can hang the towel. ü§Ø Amazing!  Also there is a contour stitching at the ends of the towel.  Usually when you wash towels that section of the towel shrinks but the rest doesn‚Äôt making the towel ‚Äúshrink‚Äù at the ends and lose its shape.  This has not happened after a hot wash and high dry cycle.  All and all - these are great towels and very affordable!!",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61NJlgGhX3L.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711mbAJgcGL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71301dbeKJL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UPDYCBT6R8LJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SLR3T9F","B07SLR3T9F","Size: 4 Piece Bath Towel Set | Color: White"

I decided to switch to white towels to make sure I could bleach them when needed. I decided on this towel after a decent amount of research. I am very glad that I did-- I can happily report that this towel is of a high quality.The good:1) This towel is extremely absorbent. It  quite literally ""sucks"" up water, which is in contrast to other lightweight white towels that I have purchased in the past.2) This towel reminds me of something that I would find at a hotel. It is very plush and soft. It is also very large-- I am a 5'8"" tall male and I can easily wrap myself in the entire towel. This towel easily covers from the chest all the way down to about a foot past the knees.3) This towel washes well and does not track lint onto other clothing.The bad:** I did not follow instructions and forgot to wash this towel upon arrival. I often have stubble on my face (fast facial hair growth, smh), so I would get ""fluff"" stuck in my stubble. This went away after a quick wash of the towel. Keep this in mind and wash before your first use! I will admit that this is my own fault, rather than the towels' fault itself.Overall-- this is a ""5* hotel quality"" towel. I would recommend it for those looking for a premium experience.",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NH-8K8EpL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71weJbjIvzL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SUD1I3Z6E18D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SLR3T9F","-","-"

"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2021","Ron ","yes","yes","WOW (HOLD THAT THOUGHT!!!)","These ""turkish cotton"" towels are awezome. To me being a guy.. A towel is a towel, but these towels are what I would think it would be like drying off on a cloud.. LOL I washed them prior to use. I thought this would make them lose their softness.. NOPE, not one bit!I'm anxious to see how long they stay in this state? I really can't think of a negative at this point, i know there must be.. But I can't think of one!! I bought the ""four pack"" & the price was right, compared to the tarjay's & wally world's, etc. So as usual I'll be sticking with Amazon at least until those other stores can offer a faster delivery (it would have to beat out my prime delivery so they'd have to do same-day.. And offer a better quality product at a lower price. Since that is unlikely to happen anytime soon.. I guess Amazon is stuck with me!!Update (31 Mar):  Well I finally used one of the towels this morning after my shower and I have to say I'm SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  For some reason, it was as if there were 1000 little linen balls all over my shower along with what looked like a dog shedding with cotton all over my shower floor.  Yes, before you ask, I washed them prior to my first use.  Washed them by themselves even.  Now that this happened I just threw the other three towels in the wash once again.  I'm hoping this takes care of the issue.  I had to take another shower just to get all the little linen balls off my body.  I sure hope this doesn't happen again after the second wash.  For now, I'm taking my rating down to three stars.  After washing again, if I don't have an issue I'll raise it back to five stars, if I end up having the same issue again, well, then I'll have to discuss this issue further with Cus. srvcUPDATE (19 April):  It's been about three weeks since my last update and unfortunately or, depending on how you look at it fortunately, this will be my last one.  The first week of April I used one of the towels again after all the towels have been washed twice.  AGAIN, the towel was like a dog shedding.  While using the towel after my shower there were hundreds of ""little lint balls"" on the shower floor.  The good thing was that there were none of these lint balls on my body as happened in the previous incident.  What I can't figure out is that these little lint balls don't happen when the towel is dry and ONLY when the towel is wet???  So I washed all the towels TWO MORE TIMES.  Why twice?  Well I washed them twice by themselves once in cold water and once in hot water.  The first time I used the ""gentle cycle"" then the second time I used the regular cycle.  I then dried them by themselves.  Both the washer and dryer are only six month's old.  After putting more effort into FOUR TOWELS THEN I'VE PUT INTO ANYTHING OVER THE PAST YEAR, IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING.  Last night when I used it after my shower, it was if I just took them out of the packaging as the lint balls started to fall off once again, but ONLY when the towel was wet.  So I only have one option and that is I won't be using these towels anymore.  I don't know if this was a FLUKE or what the problem is.  I think I've put in more effort, then I've ever put into towels in my life.  I've given it a ""fair shake"" and unfortunately the towels just don't live up to the standard that is put forth in the description.  I actually thought that after my first review, if the seller of the towels actually read these reviews maybe they might contact me. I think that if someone wasn't satisfied with one of my products I would be in contact to determine the cause & solution.  I was a bit surprised when I heard nothing.  So I was able to determine just how much this company was focused, or NOT FOCUSED ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEIR PRODUCT.  For those reasons I'm now downgrading my rating to 1-STAR and BELIEVE ME IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE ZERO STARS.  Do I recommend these towels?  NO WAY POSSIBLE I CAN HONESTLY DO THAT.  PURCHASE THESE TOWELS AT YOUR OWN RISK...I do hope this was a fluke but I'll never know because there HAS BEEN NO COMMUNICATION FROM THIS COMPANY!!!",1,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ5L1DALH8N73/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SLR3T9F","B07SLQHCWH","Size: 4 Piece Bath Towel Set | Color: Cool Grey"

At first these were not very absorant and left fuzz on my skin when drying off. However, I‚Äôve since washed them 2-3 more times and now they‚Äôre great. I recommend them.  Just know that they will improve with washing. It took about 3-4 washes before these start absorbing well and they no longer leaves fuzzThese towels are soft and a decent size (I‚Äôm a size 10-12 and these are just big enough to fully wrap around my body). They washed well too. Only negative is that these aren‚Äôt super absorbent like ‚Äúnice towels‚Äù. When drying off out the the shower you have to rub a few times to get dry. I found this odd since it says 100% Turkish Cotton on the label. I‚Äôm not familiar with Turkish cotton.. is it different than USA cotton? Idk. For the price these towels are great though. But if you‚Äôre looking for the kind of towel that soaks up water droplets just by wrapping the towel around you (like a $20+ department store towel), you might be disappointed. Would recommend if you‚Äôre on a budget.UPDATE: reducing from 4 to 3 stars due to the fuzz they leave on my skin. I would normally rate his more like a 2 but they were cheap, so best quality wasn‚Äôt expected. I have been using daily for about a week. They‚Äôve been washed once (when I first got them). I noticed some fuzz the first couple times i showered but not much because the gray against my brown skin wasn‚Äôt noticed. However I licked my lips after drying my face and got a TON of fuzz in my mouth! Like A LOT! so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going everywhere. And will probably have my dryers lent trap full after every wash. Still doesn‚Äôt absorb well at all.

Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to the hype.  Is it soft and thick? Absolutely!  The towel feels great.  But, here are two things that really detract:  1. The towel is NOT ABSORBENT.  This is the main purpose of a towel.  Maybe it's too thick, or the fibers don't have enough to wick away all the moisture.  2. The white towel change color to cream or off-white.  I followed all the instructions about how to wash this towel and I believe the blue tag on the towel bleed, which changes the towel color.  They are definitely not white anymore and has a little bit of a blue hue.  Sorry, this towel is definitely not worth the high $$$.",1,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R141J1UUOSNDS2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SLR3T9F","B07SLP5CQH","Size: 4 Piece Hand Towel Set | Color: White"

After the second wash, more shedding, more pilling.My washer is littered with lint from these towels, as is my drier, and still the fabric keeps shedding.

I read many reviews for these towels and they seemed to be fluffy, absorbent, free of lint, etc. Lint is a huge pet peeve for me because honestly, who wants to get out of the shower and drag a towel all over their body that's going to leave lint stuck to you? I washed these towels immediately upon arrival to clean off any residual lint. I also rubbed them up against my clothes to see if any lint came off and I didn't see any. They're soft and feel nice, but now that I've actually used them, I'm not impressed anymore. I was covered in tiny lint that felt like I was rubbing salt against my skin when putting on oil/lotion after the shower. I HATE that. All the towels and hand cloths I got in this order went right back into the laundry again for the 2nd time. This is the last chance they will get before donating them. There couldn't be anything worse than lint that comes from bath towels, other than they don't absorb at all...and these are marginal in that regard as well. I wouldn't recommend them unfortunately.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BSJ4BYVGONA7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SLR3T9F","B07SLR3T9F","Size: 4 Piece Bath Towel Set | Color: White"

Around half of the towels stitching cane loose following the first dry, the quality of the other stitching appears to be questionable.  It is very loose and then thread.

Personally, I enjoy these towels because it‚Äôs not so thick it‚Äôs annoying, and it‚Äôs not so large it‚Äôs annoying. It‚Äôs also not so thin that it would get soaked after drying off from a shower. It‚Äôs not incredibly soft but it‚Äôs a towel so I‚Äôm not one to care about softness. It‚Äôs about what hotel towels might feel like. I bought these because reviews said there weren‚Äôt any issues with the fibers coming off when they‚Äôre washed or wet and that‚Äôs a deal breaker for me. I will not use a towel if that‚Äôs an issue because I don‚Äôt want to dry my hands or body on a towel where the fibers come off and stick to me. After the initial wash, I think all those loose fibers came off inside the washer/dryer so I think they‚Äôre ready to go. It doesn‚Äôt seem like any fibers will be coming off from wet hands or drying from a shower so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm happy about!

More like PRISON towels -  I wasn't expecting to be bowled over, but yikes are these a disappointment. Flimsy and painfully thin, plus, they're full of loose threads and lint from a subpar weave. When drying off the water they soak up right away outweighs the weight of the terry cloth. If you've ever dried yourself off with a cheap towel than you know what this is like -- it's awful. They become sopping and drippy, slapping against you with a wet, clammy smack.Remember the hotel bathroom scene with Steve Martin and John Candy in the endearing classic ""Trains Planes and Automobiles"" ? these are those towels.They come packaged in plastic wrap, no box, no effort of presentation - if you're thinking of these as a gift, think again. Unless of course you're giving them to someone you dislike which in that case they're perfect. Opening the package they carry the perfume of rotten cucumbers - at least that's how I would describe it. I hoped after a wash they might be usable but no dice. When we bath the dogs we'll break them out so it's not a total lossIt's also worth noting that the attached cloth tags don't disclose the country of origin.

They're a standard towel. Nothing special about them. They're not any softer than any other towel you can get for a few dollars and they seem pretty small. Wish I had known they were so mediocre, I would have spent the money on something else entirely. Also, when I first got them they had a terrible smell to them, almost moldy. They have no mold or anything on them but I imagine they were probably packaged up a bit early or maybe they just have a strange smell from the factory that made them. Either way, they're okay but certainly nothing like most reviewers are making them out to be. They deserve the 3 star rating I gave them.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27CPSFH1UYMXH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SLR3T9F","B07SLQHCWH","Size: 4 Piece Bath Towel Set | Color: Cool Grey"
