They seem accurate as far as the description as such and other reviewers that I have purchased.  They wash well and seem pretty soft so far, brand I'd compare to ""the big one "" type of towels like Kohls.  I'd say it's a pretty good deal for how many towels come in the set. Time will tell if they hold up in a household of 4 people.  I ordered a set of be light green mint or a ""softer color of teal"" my 10 year old says and the yellow is very vibrant which I love and equally as soft. I will know better how they both function in comparison to one another as I've noticed per the reviews both of the quality of them depend on the color you get.Updated- 09/24/20The yellow set is like some reviews I've read about leaving some fuzz balls behind. I used them after washing them and kinda annoyed that I had to jump back in the shower to rinse off again. I washed the yellow towels 2 additional times and no leftover fuzzies. I did use about 6 dryer sheets the third time to see if that would help the cause and can't confirm that soley took away the fuzz but haven't had my orginal problem sense the 3rd time.  Just remember not to be surprised that your lint catcher the 1st time you dry them will be very lush with a layer of whatever is coming off the towels.I did not have the same problem with the light green mint type towels which is strange but overall was a good deal with saving on the ""lighting deal"" they offered.Don't just throw away the package upon receiving the towels. My package had a buisness card text offered to received 2 hand towels for free with confirmation of my order number & review. It was all legit like the card said and received them very quickly. I only received 2 free hand towels (in mint color)as there was no option choose from on which color you preferred. Not clear if it's just one offer per order but I received each set in separate packages with the free offer card but purchased both at the same time. I've reached out to seller to clarify this information, regardless I'm still happy with my purchase and wish more sellers offered free items like they do because who doesn't appreciate 2 free items. I will purchase more when the time comes.

J.","yes","yes","Red and Gray shed, but they're awesome towels","I bought 3 (burgundy, blue, green) sets for my kids and they were soft when pulled from the package. Washed each separately per instructions and they have held up so far. There was no pilling or lint balls when they came out of the dryer but the lint trap caught a lot, especially the red. So definitely wash separately  the first time per instructions.  I *love* the feel and the colors are true. They're not as thick as my Egyptian cotton towels (which is actually good since they're for kids) but they are just as soft and absorbant (took 2 turns on the dryer on low heat to dry so they definitely hold water) without the weight of my Egyptian cotton towels. Great buy. Would definitely recommend.UPDATE: I've had them about a month. Kids love how soft they are. They've been washed and they hold up well. Still soft, be careful not to burn/overdry, of course. DOWNSIDE: red sheds. Washed it with the rest and it shed a decent amount on all of them. 99% came off in the dryer (dried red separately to prevent further contamination, if you will), but something to note. Also, the gray sheds a bunch too (meaning even after 1st wash, give it and the red 2-3 independent washez before you wash with something else).

People are saying how absorbent they are, don't believe it. When water touches them it sits on top of the material instead of soaking in.  So when I try to dry my hands or my body with these, they feel very cold and wet without removing the water from me, its like, just passing the water back and forth to the towel. It's not a good feeling and I have to wipe my hands several times just to keep them from being sopping wet. This material is the pits. It's very soft.. and not cotton at all, maybe rayon or polyester? Something that does not hold water. Pretty colors though. I give it three stars for being soft, colorful and minus two stars for not doing what they are supposed to do... dry me off. Oh and.. they are VERY TINY.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2021","Allison","yes","yes","NOT “burgundy”","I bought this set of four burgundy-colored hand towels for my powder room.  I am disappointed for three reasons:  (1) the four hand towels I received are much more plain than the seller’s photo, which shows a stack of four folded towels that have a LOT more detail/design/trim to them.  I am guessing that the picture is showing four bath towels and not hand towels which are sometimes more plain (see my photo of the hand towels I received).  (2) They are not “premium quality” feeling.  I would not describe them as “thin” but they sure are not thick either.  I’d rate them a “C” regarding “feel” for a guest towel.  (3) I ordered burgundy—these are way too red and so they do not match my bath mats (see the comparison in my photos).  I would say these towels are more cranberry.  To help you gauge the color, I took a photo of them next to a Folger’s coffee container which is bright orangy-red.  For the $18.99 I paid for four, I think I would have been reasonably happy if they were at least the right color.  But given that the color and style are totally wrong, and the quality is mediocre, I am giving 3 stars.UPDATE:  I did a really dumb thing. I hung the towels looking at only the more plain end and missed the more decorative pattern at the other end of the towels!  I noticed this after I washed them and re-hung them the other way. The decoration is exactly as pictured—on one end of the towels. The other end is more plain. I increased from 3 to 4 stars. I took another photo to show you.I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.

EVERYWHERE! I have purchased towels before and I know you are supposed to wash them before using because there will be some lint. SOME lint. Dude, you should have seen how the lint trap overflowed with it. I was like, ""Holy moly that's a lot of lint""! I knew I had better not use these yet so I put them through another wash. It was just as much went the second time! I could have built a whole beach towel if I had saved it all. Nevermind the lint that is now all over my clothes, countertops, dishes, and bathtub. Never seen so much lint. I'm surprised to see that the towels had not completely disintegrated it was so much. Does this always happen and I just never noticed before because I usually buy white towels? I'm going to have to wash these a third time. Does anyone know of any specific brand of towels that do not have a lint problem? Would love to know. 9/2/21 - UPDATE - Oh my god there is so much lint! These towels have been the bane of my existence. Do not buy these towels. You would think the manufacturer would wash/beat the lint out of the product before putting it out to market. They do not! The seller should be obligated to contact the manufacturer to request this. No, they should insist! They are clearly cutting corners. The amount of lint is insane! Buy other towels!

The set is absorbent and soft to the touch. The hand towels are also longer than the usual length, which I like because there's more room for drying hands and they hang down longer from the rod, thus easier for shorter grandchildren to reach. I was careful to wash and dry the set alone before first use--as advised by the manufacturer. A lot of lint came out of the set, so I'm glad I washed them alone. I've also been careful to wash them with like colors since then as they still seem to shed lint--but mainly in the dryer. (They are shedding less and less as time goes by; I think I'm now on the fourth or fifth washing.) I also fear they may bleed color on lighter clothes. The color is still vibrant however. Other than the lint, I love these towels and rags.

As I take towels from the machine I do the hard shake. The first time I washed them I didn’t do  this because I just tossed them in the dryer. Out of nowhere my dryer broke so on my SECOND wash I talking all my towels out and they were all covered in the lint from this set.They’re cute, decent looking towels. Bright and remained this way through both washes.I had to sweep up the lint and it was almost a fist size of lint. I had to wash my washing machine to get the lint from there. I’ll use these this last time and throw them away. Buyer BEWARE!Update: I added a photo of another towel that was ruined by the yellow set.

It was rather small which immediately made me think my towels were going to be cheaply made. So point number one...vendors- make a great impression when packaging merchandise. Because now no matter how wonderful the towels actually might be I've already concluded otherwise by receiving this small box.  Okay I unrolled the jammed-packed towels, 2 sets flattened down like yesterday's pancakes and took off in a state of frenzy to the washing machine. The end result were nice soft fluffy towels, although smaller than I anticipated, and being black the color held nicely.  Point number two. Don't forget to check out the size because a few inches can make a big difference, not everyone is built like a celery stalk.  Overall there weren't any great savings and I missed the joy of feeling the towels before buying them. It's a personal thing.

I'm always leery of new towels, most are cheap low quality or shrink, but these are likely worth every penny i spent.

For the price though I can't complain too much!  I also chalk the size problem with possible manufacturing error because the embroidery stitch's (I think that is the name) appeared to vary in size.  With all that being said, though towels seemed thin they were pretty absorbent.  I like the texture of the wash clothes and the hand towels. The bath towels were very soft and comfortable to use on sensitive skin. I have washed the towels numerous times now and I am happy to say that they have not faded, there is no piling, and very little lint has come off towels from first was to present!  Finally, I am VERY PICKY so my review should only be taken lightly and that it the size variance was probably 1 out of 1,000! I don't believe that the thickness of the product was a mistake though because the towels were pretty much universally the same.",2,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1O1VD9AKTE2CA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077GQW4H2","B077GQW4H2","Size: 6 Pieces Towel Set | Color: Grey"

The last towels I bought for Christmas last year held up in the laundry. No fraying after a dozen washings.

As for lint, no more or less than other towels. I have front load Samsung w&d, couple of years old, so pretty state of the art machines. I certainly expected more lint, but it just wasn’t there.

I followed the recommended 12 hr soak in plain water before washing them separately for the first time. Sure enough all those loosened tips of twisted threads let off a healthy wad of lint in the dryer just as I was warned they would which made it much less than shocking when it happened. The result was a plush and absorbent field of soft cotton tufts which left nothing but clean skin behind. I figure each towel will be good for ten showers at least but I'll be very interested in tracking real-life results including the amount of lint in the second and third washes.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTEV4HU332MOR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077GQW4H2","B077GSSDVZ","Size: 4 Pieces Bath Towels | Color: Navy Blue"

I was gonna return it but there was an instruction saying it will fluff up after washing for the first time before use. I did that thinking it would get thicker. It didn't! Now I can't return it since I opened and washed it. The people who gave this higher ratings probably have lower standards. I'm sorry.  Did not like this purchase at all!
