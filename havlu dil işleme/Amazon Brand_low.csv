"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2015",MariamG,yes,yes,"Pinzon in Plum, Pretty and Plush!  See Photos and Links.......","***Updated review.I purchased these towels in spite of the mixed reviews and pictures of damaged towels... One reason being the low $21.99 price point for the set of 6 towels, another being the slightly larger bath towels at 30""x 56"" (standard is 27x54).Also, I read reviews stating that the plum is slightly lighter than pictured and this is what I was hoping for. I figured they were worth a risk as I noticed the reviewers who noted the plum color didn't seem to have as many negative reviews.They arrived quickly and my husband and I both agreed that they appear to be thick and beautiful. That said, I can't yet comment on quality, in terms of longevity, but will be updating this review after a few months of use and numerous washes.I am very particular about how I launder clothing and the likes, so my findings will only really apply for others who do the same... I don't wash towels with jeans or other articles with zippers or anything that could snag them (or that the towels would wear down).I use Perwoll detergent for darks which preserves and renews dark colors beautifully (sold here on Amazon, pricey but a little goes a long way and its worth it) and I don't use detergents with regular fillers which buildup on clothes.     Lastly, I use wool dryer balls and do not use fabric softener (which especially shouldn't be used with towels since it leaves a coating on them, making them less absorbent).     I uploaded some pictures so you can see the plum. I laid out a couple of purple cardigans next to them that are more of a true purple or plum, for comparison. These are a slightly smokey plum (more plum than gray, just a touch more muted shade). Very plush, especially for under $22, and much prettier than expected!Definitely recommend, at the very least, for towels on display getting little use. No snags or poor quality apprearance upon arrival - from Pinzon seller via Amazon, in Plum.Happy shopping! Smile.*UPDATE* After first wash, no more dryer lint than with any other new towel set I've purchased. No fuzzies sticking to wet skin or shedding. Color and overall look is as good as new... More to come if anything changes...After a month of use, a number of washes and dryings, we are super happy with this set!  We will be ordering another set while we can (noticed the seperates in plum are no longer available and the HUGE bath mat in plum is now also gone- very plush!).  I do recommend it though, (still available in other colors) see my review with photos here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ESKH88D6JLD7/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000T2T8RKHope this helps!",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TUbsldeJL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710MFJjtz1L.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711zeW1fOeL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18YTP2STB99CN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI,B007K6SOTQ,Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Plum

Then I ran the load through the air only cycle for 20 minutes and again a full lint filter, then ran them again on air only for 20 min.and again a full lint filter.

More on the bath towels and hand towels. Several so bad that the backing of the towel is thread bare. Will post pics. There is no excuse for this !I have not used them so I can't speak to durability, but I do know that my other Egyptian towels from Walmart and Overstock.com did not shed and shag like these towels have done.

These are nowhere near the quality of the prior version. They are lighter, thinner, and even the label is a cheap plastic label rather than a fabric label. Very disappointed that the quality has been compromised. I don't understand when you have a great product, does every new product manager have to justify their existence by making it cheaper? I mean, yes, you make more money, but isn't the whole point of having a great product is that it remains great? Who are these people who make these decisions to cheapen products.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2016",Grandma Zizzy,yes,yes,Really liked these... until the washcloths started getting splotches all over them!,"2/3/17 update:  For our whole adult lives, both my husband and I have had to pinch pennies, so we're hardly what you'd call ""towel snobs""... we had our two sets of ""good towels"" which were used only for company (and to dry off our grandkids during sleepovers - they're the most important ""company"" in our lives!), and then there were the towels we ourselves use... and have been using for eons!  But this year, I decided to splurge a bit in that area for my hard-working, blue collar hubby, googled ""Egyptian cotton towels"" (since I'd heard Egyptian cotton was the creme de la creme, with its longer, more dense threads/thread loops that pull moisture away from your body while trapping the warmth of that moisture at the same time) and this set of Pinzon towels popped up.  Seemed a pretty decent price for quality, so I went ahead and ordered a couple of sets for him - he's a big guy, and was thrilled to have these generously sized towels after a long day!  He could not care less about such things, but I loved the border designing.First, I wish I'd done a little more research before making the purchase.  Had NO idea that Amazon had started its own private label lines years ago, including this Pinzon label (bed & bath, table top kitchen tools/accessories, indoor furnishings)!  The others are Strathwood (outdoor furnishings/lighting), Pike Street (a ""value"" line of bed/bath), and Denali (tools/accessories), and apparently they made the move to try to give its customers great value at competitive prices.  I knew the GSM (grams per square meter) number was important when looking at towels (i.e. 300-400 are pretty thin/light weight, 400-600 are considered medium weight/thickness, while 600-900 are the super absorbent, thick and heavy feeling towels that you typically find in upscale hotels or spas.)  Since we don't often (NEVER!) frequent those types of places, I was pretty happy when I saw the 600 GSM number on these towels.  When I went to write my review, I happened to see Pinzon's LUXURY towels - an 820 GSM for not too much more!  Another thing to keep in mind when buying Egyptian towels is to make sure the label doesn't say ""made with"" Egyptian cotton... they also contain standard cotton and sometimes even polyester!  The label should say 100% Egyptian cotton - these do.  And I guess the other thing is that while Egyptian IS the ""cadillac"", Pima cotton is grown in America and creates a towel similar in GSM to Egyptian, and Turkish cotton is also a quality cotton - again, the key with all three (Egyptian, Pima or Turkish) is making sure it says ""100%"".I washed them a couple of times before using to get rid of the chemical smell and - while there was quite a bit of lint the first time around, there wasn't as much the second, and they certainly weren't falling apart as I'd read about in some of the other reviews.  HOWEVER... after my husband began using them, I started noticing white splotches on the wash cloths as I'd also read about in other reviews (though NOT on the hand or bath towels.)  We're now close to 2 months into use, with the wash cloths splotched all over the place but no splotches at all on the hand or bath towels!  As I was folding laundry yesterday and shaking my head over the splotches, it finally hit me.  My husband uses an astringent to clean his face of work grime when he gets home from work, using the wash cloths, so I believe it's one of the ingredients in the astringent that's reacting with the dye in the hand cloth!  Depending upon the type of soap/cleanser or laundry detergent other reviewers are using, I'm betting it could be a similar reaction.  But I'll tell ya - NONE of our old wash cloths reacted this way to his astringent, so whatever dyes they're using in the Pinzon plants much be pretty cheap.  Amazon's attempt to to give its customers ""great value at competitive prices"" should not mean taking shortcuts that don't allow a product to perform under typical usage!",2,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1340AOL53HGYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI,B002S52ZKS,Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Grey

"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2016",Anna Harper,yes,yes,"Cheap Disposable Towels, Into The Landfill They Go","This is one of the worst purchase I have ever made here on Amazon. In a word, this product is garbage. It truly is. If I could give this towel set no stars I sure would. I feel like I just flushed my money down the proverbial toilet, but what I am really upset about is the waste of resources. Recycling is very important to me. I guess I can use them for rags or for my own use when I don't have guests around, but not for guest towels like I wanted to.I have bought Pinzon products in the past and enjoyed a certain level of quality. I read the reviews and they were mixed. So, I decided to give them a try, based on my past experiences with the Pinzon name. I thought that maybe they just got one bad towel. I will never buy Pinzon products again.For the cost the thickness and quality of the product appeared to good when I opened the package, little did I know that the towels had hidden issues I wouldn't see until later.These towels are one time use, they are just disposable and will fill a landfill somewhere. After one use and washing they are fading in small areas, turning orange. Clearly they not color fast. You can see the color fading in the photo. I used one set and washed it, every single one had the same issue. And I know that it isn't from leftover bleach from a previous wash or anything like that.

I washed the towels a couple of times, but it is permanently damaged. It seems to me that the dye is super poor quality. It should not change color when just wiping hands from having washed them with soap. Even if it gets a little bit of soap leftover on it, quality dye would not turn color instantly. Yes, the color turns instantly as you wipe your hands.

"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2019",Oakspear,yes,yes,Great Towels for the Money,"I had been needing some new towels for a while. When I saw these towels on Amazon for a low price I was excited at first, but then I started reading the mixed reviews, which gave me pause. However, I decided to go ahead and give them a try anyway, and I'm glad I did so.These towels are soft to the touch, look great, and are very absorbent. They've held up well through multiple washings and I have yet to see any fading except for a couple of the hand towels (Which was expected; I'll come back to that later).After reading some of the other reviews, I noticed that a lot of people are upset with the amount of shedding from these towels. Here's the deal: Almost all towels are going to shed through the first few washings. I've had cheap towels from Wal-Mart and premium ones from Bed, Bath, & Beyond, and one thing they ALL had in common was that they shed like crazy through the first half-dozen or so washings. It just comes with the territory. Shedding doesn't mean that the towels are of poor quality; it's just something that towels do (in fact, I'd be worried about the long-term durability of towels that DON'T shed at first).Now, about the hand towels I mentioned earlier. I set aside a couple of the hand towels to use with my Proactiv acne treatments. Proactiv (and any other acne treatment that contains benzol peroxide) is going to make your clothes and towels fade. For that reason, I made it a point to buy a couple of extra hand towels and use them just for drying my face after I apply my treatment, as I knew they would probably fade badly as a result (and they did). The same has happened to every other set of towels I've owned, so I don't hold it against the towels themselves; it's just the effect that benzol peroxide has on fabric.Overall, I've very please with the quality of these towels. Another good bargain from Amazon.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P0EW29Q4RJCV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI,B002S52ZGC,Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Cocoa

"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2015",Dan Skinner,yes,yes,"Lots, and lots, and lots of lint","Got these towels after I purchased a much more expensive set, and was thoroughly disappointed.These towels were actually softer than the 900gm cotton towel set I recently returned to Amazon.I purchased the towels in a Wedgewood color, and they arrived looking just like they were advertised (sometimes the colors tend to be off).  I immediately washed them, and when I pulled them from my washer, the inside of the washer was FILLED with wet lint (had to run a cycle to clean it).  Then into the dryer they went.  So much lint came off the towels that it was more than my dryer filter could handle.  I pulled the lint off and had larger than a facecloth size of towel remnants in my hand.  The lint was thicker than a roll of Scotch Tape, and longer than a soda bottle (see pictures).The good news is that, even after shedding more than a Siberian Husky in the Mojave Desert at Noontime in June, the towels look great.  They feel quite soft, and, after having been used the for the first time, are quite absorbent.I'd recommend these towels to anyone looking for a soft, absorbent set of true-to-color, bath set.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2015",Kipsydoodle,yes,yes,"If You Like Lint, These Are The Towels For You","Oh brother. I never thought to read reviews of towels but I kind of regret that now. I did look at the stars which showed an average of 4 and while that might make me do further research for other kinds of products, it seemed acceptable for towels. Of course I pre-washed them before use and was amazed at the stunning amount of lint. First I washed them with some other towels. Those towels had so much lint stuck to them I had to wash and dry them again separately. I then rewashed and re-dried the Pinzon towels and wound up with another totally full lint filter (see photo 1). When I took the towels out of the dryer the 2nd time an abundance of fine 'towel dust' began to fall off the towels so I decided to wash and dry them again. I carefully put them back in the washer so I wouldn't have a layer of towel dust all over my kitchen. I washed them - without detergent of any kind - and dried them again. This time it looked as though the lint had been tackled, there was only ½ a filter full of lint (see photo 2). I had no problem with the towels unraveling but this time one of the hand towels had spots where the color came out of the towel (see photo 3). This towel will be used as a rag. Also, by this time the once soft towels felt coarse and uninviting. I decided to use the bath towel for my next shower to see if it was okay to use. It was indeed very scratchy. I'm going to try to bring back some of the softness with dryer sheets but if that doesn't work I will have at the end of this ridiculous process a $22 set of rags.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2015",Rebecca,yes,yes,"Best Towels for the Price, read on","The Pinzon Egyptian Towels appear to be well made, good quality towels.I normally pay a lot of money for bath towels as I like superior quality and towels that last.  I needed some new towels for my guest bathrooms and didn't want to spend a lot of money because we really don't have guests that often.  I like that the Pinzon Egyptian Cotton Towels are available in sets with the hand towels and washcloths.I purchased 8 sets of the towels for our guest bathrooms.  My expectations weren't that high.  When researching what towels to purchase, I normally look for high GSM (grams per square meter).  The higher the number, the more absorbent and heavier the towel is, which generally leads to a towel that will last longer.  I couldn't find anything in the description of these towels that told what the GSM is, so I went totally off the shipping weight.  One 6-piece set (2 bath towels, 2 hand towels, 2 washcloths) weighs 4.3 pounds, which is fairly high for towels in this price range.  In comparison, the Amazon Basics 6-piece set is a couple dollars cheaper, but only weighs 3.2 pounds.  The Utopia set is an 8-piece set (comes with 4 washcloths), cost 5 dollars more, yet only weighs 3.85 pounds.I was impressed with the quality of the towels when they arrived.  I washed the towels before putting them out with a cup of vinegar to remove the protective coating that the towel makers put on towels and to help seal in the color to reduce future fading.  The towels came out of the dryer nice and soft and fluffy.  They have the appearance of a much more expensive towel.Are there better towels out there?  Yes, but for more money.  In my opinion, these are the best towels you'll find for the current price on Amazon of $21.99 per set.",4,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712922uYnBL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bQLKO7GOL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71f57+oAIZL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71jXhIXYR+L.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wKEQF0W+L.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GcRsFYMOL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81a4ogNl5xL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTEAMDJMSO1PN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI,B002S52ZEY,Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Driftwood
"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2015",cira,yes,yes,Unfinished Product...,"I had ordered these towels because the price was right and most of the reviews were positive. I'm not sure what inspired the good reviews. Fresh out of the box, every towel had loose threads. I attempted to tie off one of them hoping I could get away with using them, but the the threads pulled very easily. I could imagine if I chose to wash them that they would unravel in the dryer. The towels are nice and big, but the quality is awful. As for how the towels felt, I would say that target sells softer. I don't recommend wasting your money here.",2,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eZYbYrPGL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812dC5p7ddL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816TBSnYwRL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816ZY5naZ4L.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Dmkbp+Q1L.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Ugyk1d0dL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81exS4R9ydL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qMRzRAqBL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81u+DnfM4JL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19RQ7FZLMVG4F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002S52ZFI,B002S52ZKS,Size: 6-Piece Set | Color: Grey
