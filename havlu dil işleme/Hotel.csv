Was nervous about the reviews stating that it doesn’t dry you off. Well I used the towel the first time without washing it first and it seemed to not really absorb the water very well and lots of fuzzies coming off. So I washed it and hung it up to dry for a bit then put it in the dryer.  It didn’t break my washer when it was wet, it was a bit heavy but not an issue.  So I’ve used it 3 more times since I washed it and it’s a dream. So soft and absorbs better now. Love it. I’m buying another one right now.  The fuzzies aren’t bad now either.  LOVE IT!!!  Well worth the money.9/25/2019. Update:  the towels are still super fuzzy and I hate that. I’m covered in fuzzy lint after I dry off.

Having traveled to Turkey, I so appreciate their cotton.  It is the kind of soft quality cotton that you find in t-shirts and underwear at Marks and Spencer in London if you are familiar.  These towels are nice and large.  Be sure to wash and dry them first in cold water using Woolite for Darks detergent and they will maintain their color best if you are buying black.  With initial wash, a lot of fuzz will come off which is part of their manufacturing.  The seller included a nice thank you note which shows they care and offers a discount card on future purchases which I intend to use.  The black is jet black, not charcoal as others sometimes are.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2020","LizGM","yes","yes","Towel feelings are very subjective but here's my attempt to be objective","**5 month update**I thought it worth updating my review since I'm changing my rating to 5 stars. Why? Because the towels have only gotten better. They have not faded in the slightest (still washing them in HOT), they've gotten more absorbent yet are still soft, and they don't leave ANY lint on me when I dry myself and hardly any in the dryer. These are indeed high quality towels, would 100% purchase again. Unfortunately, I don't need to - but I would!Original review:After reading many of the reviews for these towels which spanned the spectrum between love and hate, I realized that how one feels about towels is VERY subjective. After all, not everyone wants the same thing from a towel.  For example, apparently many people want fluffy, soft towels.  Personally, I hate that - I want thin absorbent towels. Furthermore, the aggressiveness of one's washing machine needs to be taken into account. One machine can shred an averagely constructed towel; another (like mine, which is very wussy) will be lucky to give it a barely decent wash.(By the way, the ONLY reason I bought these towels was because of the color. I couldn't find aquamarine towels anywhere else for less than $50, hence this purchase. Color trumped all other requirements for me.)Anyhoo, that being said, here is my review, which is based on my personal preferences:- The towels are soft and fluffy. Great for sleeping and perhaps protection from cold bathroom air; not so great for absorbency. Sure, they're OK, but I like my cheap rough towels that suck up water like a sponge.- I washed my towels in hot water in my wussy front loader machine when I got them and yes, they dyed the two white rags that I washed them with (deliberately, as a test) light blue.  Ummm... duh.- The towels shed profusely in the dryer. Not enough to overwhelm my lint collector, however, but my dryer is also a bit on the wussy side. I expected no less because, um, they're new towels. Again.... duh.- Drying off with the towels did leave a wee bit of lint on my body but not enough to get excited about. Used the hand towels before putting in my contacts and had no problems, if that helps clarify ""wee bit"".  I'm sure in another wash or two that'll end.- Subsequent washing (still hot water, mind you) occurred only with like colors so I didn't notice any color transfer. Shedding was significantly less. Yah.In summary: I think these are good towels. I love, love, love the color - just looking at them makes me happy.  I wish they were thinner and more absorbent, but give 'em 15-20 years and I'm sure they will be. In the meantime, it's nice to know these towels could second as emergency blankets in cold weather.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AYKXFBZIE4QE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NYFP1Y3","B078JWRBFH","Size: 6 Piece TURKISH COTTON TOWEL SET | Color: Ocean Aqua"

The light brown towels and moss green towels and purple violet towels were all as pictured. I was hesitant to get them due to a few bad ratings but liked the purple to go ahead with replacing all our personal and guest towels.  I did wash each set separately cool water and dryer on medium low for two thirty minute increments to empty the lint bin. I used a laundry sanitizer with a little detergent.

It is a single bath sheet with no décor or added design - which is just what we wanted.  It's sooo hard to find a towel of any size that doesn't have that extra design across it near the edge. That design tends to bunch-up after multiple washings because it's different from the remainder of the towel and this towel doesn't have it which is great!  This towel is 40 x 60 inches, which is also hard to find size.  It washed well; it didn't seem to be effected at all by the washing - even with the dark navy blue color (no color bleeds or beading of fabric).  The price wasn't necessarily a bargain, but from the shopping I did, both on line and at multiple brick n mortar stores, I've concluded the price was reasonable relative to the quality and size.

Its ample size together with its thick tuft makes it heavier than an ordinary towel but it does an excellent job of absorbing water/drying.  This towel does not just push the water around as some others that I have purchased tend to do.  It actually absorbs the water on the first pass!  I am very pleased with my purchase.  The only question I have (as others have also stated) is that the towel did seem to lose a substantial amount of tuft after the first wash and dry cycle.

If there is some cotton content in these towels it must be a small fraction. They have the plushness, squeaky skin feel, and lack of absorbency of polyester fleece or acrylic. We cannot use them as towels. Our geriatric cats will certainly like them, and since they are made mostly of synthetic fibers the vomit stains and occasional diarrhea should clean out of them nicely. But since they are only useful as pet blankets these “towels” are definitely not worth the price, and the fraud is infuriating.

"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","Kate","yes","yes","Okay, but not the best","I thought these looked decent in the photos and what I got in the mail matched, so I was initially happy. Unfortunately problems started after the first wash. The manufacturer cheeped out and the material wasn't preshrunk. So after the initial wash and dry, they shrunk and now the edges curl up and it doesn't like to lay flat. It wasn't a massive issue since they are absorbent and that was important. I bought a second set so I could wash them frequently and imagine my surprise when a radically different grey color arrived. I double checked, I ordered the exact same thing both times, but first time I got charcoal and the second a significantly lighter grey. So if you're picky on things matching this brand isn't trustworthy when it comes to product consistency.I'll use these when I'm cleaning the shower and need something to absorb any over spray but I've just ordered some by mDesign. I'm hoping those are better, they're not much more expensive but the brand is consistent when it comes to quality.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5SZAG8YMLGFU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NYFP1Y3","B078NDLPHZ","Size: Two-Packed Floor BATH MAT Towel | Color: Charcoal Grey"

They are everything I need to feel securely wrapped in luxury.  These are definitely the best towels I have every owned.  I got them in purple just for fun and they did give off a good amount of lint in the wash the first couple washes.

I am super picky and fussy!  I read every review and balanced my cumulative knowledge to make a well-informed decision.  I chose these, and I am SOO HAPPY with my purchase!!  Soft, thick, fluffy, absorbent, luxurious, wash well, no shrinkage (washed each of my 2 colors separately in warm water, with very little lint in dryer trap, as well!), durable - no fraying or discolored spots when washed - worth the money!!  They are everything you are looking for in a bathroom hand towel.  Oh, and I bought the Yellow and the Navy, as picture shows.  (They actually are squashed a bit to fit on that particular closet shelf, but they stand taller and fluffier on their own!)  I searched for just the right shade of yellow, as well, to match a decor item in my bathroom.  These towels were spot on bright canary yellow - not at all ""gold"" or ""light, pale yellow.""

Cannot recommend.","Short version:I've been buying, washing and using my own towels for more decades than I like to admit. That said, these are easily the shabbiest quality towels I have ever owned.  Even the cheapies I bought at discount stores when I was younger held up to simple washing much better.Details:Per usual, I washed these new towels by themselves after receiving this set. I was genuinely amazed at how much lint was left in the washer and utility tub where it drains.  After seeing this, I was actually a bit concerned about the washing machine pump and filter, but so far so good.A trip through the dryer removed an equally amazing amount of material from these new towels. If you can't tell from the picture, there were stray 'chunks' of string and lint throughout the dryer and the lint filter was easily  3/4"" or more thick.  This was before the towels were even completely dry.At this point, there was no way I was going to use these towels as they were, so I ran them through another wash-dry cycle with disturbingly similar results.  The image with water in the washer is the cold rinse cycle of the *second* washing using dye-free detergent and it left nearly as much material in the tub of the washer.  The towels fared roughly as well the second time through the dryer.As others have noted, the stitching is subpar on both bath towels and one hand towel.  The others look to be okay after two washings and zero uses, so far.",2,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ziD3jkqsL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FPcFHkqNL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lh8-g+mfL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hbVyYgWTL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ijngIWCmL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sN5uG16XL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18GPLSLBK1L9N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NYFP1Y3","B078JWRBFH","Size: 6 Piece TURKISH COTTON TOWEL SET | Color: Ocean Aqua"

Usually I'm pretty reasonable when it comes to wear and tear on very inexpensive fabric items and if these weren't being sold at the outrageous price of ~$30 a piece, I probably wouldn't even be chiming in here but this feels like a robbery. This is legit the first thing I've bought from Amazon that couldn't even make it through one wash/ dry cycle and while ~$60 I might not ever get back might not seem like much in the grand scheme of things, it still feels pretty significant.

They are thick and soft. But there are what I feel to be significant flaws that will lead to my replacing these (too late to return because I thought all the problems would be remedied by multiple washings) in the near future: (1) Fuzzies shedding everywhere. In my shower. In my sink. On my face. On my underarms. I thought this would go away after several washings, but it’s not, and I’m sick of picking them off of my body and cleaning them up. (2) The dye just keeps leeching. Again, I thought this would go away after multiple washings. But when I wet a washcloth and wring it out, I can see the black dye swirling in my sink. And I’m about to use this rag to wash my face. (3) They are not nearly as absorbent as you would think. They are so soft and thick, it makes you think they would soak up all the water. But for some inexplicable reason, they do not. No matter how much time I spend drying off, there is still have a layer of water droplets on my body. Not so bad when it’s warm, but as winter approaches, it makes me cold for awhile until I air dry. Some may feel I am expecting too much, but I had a nice set I bought from Bed Bath and Beyond that had none of these qualities. I guess I will have to brave the retail store with a mask and replace these sets I regret.",2,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7CNS7SOEMSS7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NYFP1Y3","B085SVN28Y","Size: 6 Piece TURKISH COTTON TOWEL SET | Color: Coal Black"

When these new towels first arrived from Amazon, I was satisfied with appearance, softness, and absorbency and thought I had found a good replacement. But after 4 washings, I am rather disappointed.  Like others have reported, these towels completely overwhelmed my dryer’s lint filter with no slowing down after 4 washings.  I literally try to remember to clean the filter mid cycle to avoid this.

Not a pleasant experience to use these towels.  Additionally, even after the first wash, they shed quite a bit of towel fuzz.  After the second they are fine, although still very poor absorbance.

I just had to review this product hoping that someone might not make the mistake to purchase these. These towels are the worst quality of towel I have EVER purchased. Took them out, washed all 6 with cold water on gentle cycle, and put them in the dryer on low heat. When they came out of the drier, 3 of the 6 towels were totally frayed along the outer stitching and had little loops of material sticking out everywhere. I purchased another set of towels the same day from another manufacturer for 8 dollars less per set and they were twice as good as these things. If it were not such a hassle I would send them back, but instead I will just cut them up and use them for rags in my shop, although they probably wont last long there either!!! $40 totally wasted. would have been better off flushing my money down the old commode!",1,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25Q7MQOI81XC8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NYFP1Y3","B07NYFP1Y3","Size: 6 Piece TURKISH COTTON TOWEL SET | Color: Charcoal Grey"

The only issue I've had with these towels is when I washed them initially a lot of navy blue fluff was left in my washing machine. I have had that problem with previous towels though so I think it's fairly normal for the first few washes. The colour hasn't faded and they really do feel quite luxurious and fluffy. I'm going to purchase the extra large bath sheet that goes with this set as well since I'm so impressed with the quality.

They are turkish cotton & they truly are the softest, most absorbent towels EVER!!! There was NO excessive lint in the washer or dryer, even after washing them for the first time.I absolutely LOVE the purple colour. Purple is my favourite colour & these are beautiful!! I can't wait to get in the shower, just so I can use these wonderfully soft towels to dry off with. Having a full set is nice because the bigger ones are a really good size bath towel & the hand towels are great for drying my hair or as an extra towel to soak up excess water after the shower first.
